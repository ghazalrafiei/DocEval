 * A BSONElement::ComparatorInterface is an abstract class for comparing BSONElement objects. Usage
 * for comparing two BSON elements, 'lhs' and 'rhs', where 'comparator' is an instance of a class
 * implementing this interface, is as shown below:
 *
 *  bool lessThan = comparator.evaluate(lhs < rhs);
 *  bool lessThanOrEqual = comparator.evaluate(lhs <= rhs);
 *  bool equal = comparator.evaluate(lhs == rhs);
 *  bool greaterThanOrEqual = comparator.evaluate(lhs >= rhs);
 *  bool greaterThan = comparator.evaluate(lhs > rhs);
 *  bool notEqual = comparator.evaluate(lhs != rhs);
 *
 * Can also be used to obtain function objects compatible for use with standard library algorithms
 * such as std::sort, and to construct STL sets and maps which respect this comparator.
 *
 * All methods are thread-safe.
