['text':'* ConstElement recapitulates all of the const methods of Element, but cannot be converted
 *  to an Element. This makes it safe to return as a value from a constant Document, since
 *  none of Element's non-const methods may be called on ConstElement or any values it
 *  yields. If you think of Element like an STL 'iterator', then ConstElement is a
 *  'const_iterator'.
 *
 *  For details on the API methods of ConstElement, please see the method comments for the
 *  analagous Element methods in the file element.h (in this same directory).
 *
 *  All calls on ConstElement are simply forwarded to the underlying Element.
