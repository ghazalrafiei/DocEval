     * Fills 'keys' with the keys that should be generated for 'obj' on this index.

     * This function ignores the 'multikeyPaths' pointer because text indexes don't support tracking
     * path-level multikey information.
     *
     * If the 'multikeyPaths' pointer is non-null, then it must point to an empty vector. This
     * function resizes 'multikeyPaths' to have the same number of elements as the index key pattern
     * and fills each element with the prefixes of the indexed field that would cause this index to
     * be multikey as a result of inserting 'keys'.
