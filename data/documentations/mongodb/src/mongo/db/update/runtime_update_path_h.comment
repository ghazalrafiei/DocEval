 * This class represents a path which can be taken through a specific document. In addition to the
 * path components, which are stored as a FieldRef, RuntimeUpdatePath also stores the "type" of
 * each component, which can be either kFieldName or kArrayIndex. Non-numeric components are always
 * of type kFieldName. Numeric components may either be field names (in the case of an object like
 * {"123": "foo"}) or array indexes.
 *
 * Unlike other path representations in our codebase, RuntimeUpdatePath is tied to a particular
 * document. It does not represent a path that a user provides as part of an update.
 *
 * Example:
 * Document: {a: {0: {b: ["foo", "bar"]}}}.
 *
 * The path to "bar" would be represented as "a.0.b.1" where "a" "0" and "b" are of type kFieldName
 * while "1" is of type kArrayIndex.
