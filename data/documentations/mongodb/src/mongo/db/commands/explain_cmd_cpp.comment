 * The explain command is used to generate explain output for any read or write operation which has
 * a query component (e.g. find, count, update, remove, distinct, etc.).
 *
 * The explain command takes as its argument a nested object which specifies the command to
 * explain, and a verbosity indicator. For example:
 *
 *    {explain: {count: "coll", query: {foo: "bar"}}, verbosity: "executionStats"}
 *
 * This command like a dispatcher: it just retrieves a pointer to the nested command and invokes
 * its explain() implementation.
