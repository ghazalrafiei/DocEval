['text':'*
 * Returns the query needed to find incremental changes to the chunks collection on a shard server.
 *
 * The query has to find all the chunks $gte the current max version. Currently, any splits, merges
 * and moves will increment the current max version. Querying by lastmod is essential because we
 * want to use the {lastmod} index on the chunks collection. This makes potential cursor yields to
 * apply split/merge/move updates safe: updates always move or insert documents at the end of the
 * index (because the document updates always have higher lastmod), so changed always come *after*
 * our current cursor position and are seen when the cursor recommences.
 *
 * The sort must be by ascending version so that the updates can be applied in-memory in order. This
 * is important because it is possible for a cursor to read updates to the same _id document twice,
 * due to the yield described above. If updates are applied in ascending version order, the newer
 * update is applied last.

 * Writes a persisted signal to indicate that it is once again safe to read from the chunks
 * collection for 'nss' and updates the collection's collection placement version to

 * secondaries know they can safely use the chunk metadata again.
 *
 * It is safe to call this multiple times: it's an idempotent action.

 * Reads the shard server's chunks collection corresponding to 'nss' for chunks matching 'query',

 * fields, because we do not yet have UUIDs to replace epochs nor UUIDs associated with namespaces.

['text':'*
 * Takes a vector of 'chunks' and updates the shard's chunks collection for 'nss'. Any chunk
 * documents in config.cache.chunks.<ns> that overlap with a chunk in 'chunks' is removed as the
 * updated chunk document is inserted. If the epoch of a chunk in 'chunks' does not match
 * 'currEpoch', a ConflictingOperationInProgress error is returned and no more updates are applied.

 * Note: two threads running this function in parallel for the same collection can corrupt the
 * collection data!
 *
 * nss - the collection namespace for which chunk metadata is being updated.
 * chunks - chunks retrieved from the config server, sorted in ascending chunk version order.
 * currEpoch - what this shard server expects the collection epoch to be.
 *
 * Returns:
 * - ConflictingOperationInProgress if the chunk version epoch of any chunk in 'chunks' is different
 *   than 'currEpoch'.
 * - Other errors if unable to do local writes/reads to the config.chunks.ns collection.

 * Deletes locally persisted chunk metadata associated with 'nss': drops the chunks collection

 * The order is important because the secondary observes changes to the config.collections entries.

 * retries, rather than returning with a useful error message.
