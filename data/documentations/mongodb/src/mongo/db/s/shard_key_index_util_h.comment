     * Wraps information pertaining to the 'index' used as the shard key.
     *
     * A clustered index is not tied to an IndexDescriptor whereas all other types of indexes
     * are. Either the 'index' is a clustered index and '_clusteredIndexKeyPattern' is
     * non-empty, or '_indexDescriptor' is non-null and a standard index exists.

 * Returns an index suitable for shard key range scans if it exists.
 *
 * This index:
 * - must be prefixed by 'shardKey', and
 * - must not be a partial index.
 * - must have the simple collation.
 * - must not be hidden.
 *
 * If the parameter 'requireSingleKey' is true, then this index additionally must not be
 * multi-key.

 * Returns true if the given index exists and it is the last non-hidden index compatible with the
 * ranged shard key. False otherwise. Hashed indexes are excluded here because users are allowed
 * to drop shard key compatible hashed indexes.
