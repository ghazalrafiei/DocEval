     * through the following means:
     *  - At step-up recovery time - the catalog starts empty and the coordinators inserted are read
     *    from the `config.coordinators` collection, which only contains unique entries
     *  - At regular run time - the session check-out mechanism guarantees that calls to get,
     *    followed by insert are atomic for the same lsid + txnNumber + txnRetryCounter
