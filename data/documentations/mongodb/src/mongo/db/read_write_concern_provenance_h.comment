 * This class represents the "provenance" (ie. original source) of a read or write concern.
 *
 * This information is serialized as a 'provenance' field inside readConcern/writeConcern objects,
 * which is parsed, stored, and forwarded, but has no other effect on the meaning of the read or
 * write concern (RWC).  This means it is possible to see (in logs, currentOp, profiling, etc) where
 * a given RWC has come from.  It also makes it possible for the server to adjust its behavior based
 * on the origin of the RWC (even though the semantics of the RWC itself have not changed), for
 * example, by having special metrics that only apply to RWC from certain sources.
 *
 * Possible sources are:
 *
 *   - unset (ie. the 'provenance' field was absent):
 *     Implicitly means "clientSupplied" (so drivers do not need to send a 'provenance' field).
 *
 *   - "clientSupplied":
 *     The RWC was originally explicitly passed to a mongos or plain replica set member by the
 *     driver.
 *
 *   - "implicitDefault":
 *     The client did not supply an explicit RWC, and there was no RWC default, so this RWC
 *     represents the corresponding implicit server default, ie. read concern of "local" (except
 *     "available" on sharded secondaries) and {w: 1, wtimeout: 0}.
 *
 *   - "customDefault":
 *     Represents an admin-defined cluster-wide RWC default that was applied to the operation
 *     because no explicit RWC was provided, and there was a custom RWC default defined at the time.
 *
 *   - "getLastErrorDefaults":
 *     Only applicable to write concern, and indicates that it originated from the (deprecated)
 *     'settings.getLastErrorDefaults' field of the replica set configuration.
 *
 *   - "internalWriteDefault":
 *     Only applicable to write concern on internal writes, and indicates that the internal client
 *     did not supply an explicit write concern, so this write concern represents the corresponding
 *     server default for internal writes, ie. {w: 1, wtimeout: 0}.
 *
 * A ReadWriteConcernProvenance object may only have a single Source value throughout its lifetime;
 * once the Source has been set, attempting to change it will trigger an invariant.  This ensures
 * the integrity of the provenance value as the operation makes its way through the server (and
 * through the overall cluster).

     *
     * Apart from the initial transition from kUnset to some other Source value, the source of a
     * provenance must not be changed during its lifetime, and this function enforces that property
     * with an invariant.  This is to prevent provenances from being accidentally clobbered with
     * incorrect values.
