 * An internal match expression node which represents a field path's hash being equal to the given
 * NumberLong constant. This expression is not intended to be written directly by users, but rather
 * generated by a rewrite of {$expr: {$eq: [{$toHashedIndexKey: '$fieldPath'}, NumberLong(123)]}}.
 * The purpose of this is to allow us to generate index bounds on a hashed index to satisfy such a
 * query.
