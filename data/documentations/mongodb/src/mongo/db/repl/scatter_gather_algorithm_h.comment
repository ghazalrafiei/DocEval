 * Interface for a specialization of a scatter-gather algorithm that sends
 * requests to a set of targets, and then processes responses until it has
 * seen enough.
 *
 * To use, call getRequests() to get a vector of request objects describing network operations.
 * Start performing the network operations in any order, and then, until
 * hasReceivedSufficientResponses() returns true, call processResponse for each response as it
 * arrives.  Once hasReceivedSufficientResponses() you may cancel outstanding network
 * operations, and must stop calling processResponse.  Implementations of this interface may
 * assume that processResponse() is never called after hasReceivedSufficientResponses() returns
 * true.
