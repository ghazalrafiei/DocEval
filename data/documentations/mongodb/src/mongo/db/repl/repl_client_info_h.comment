     * Use this to set the LastOp to the latest known OpTime in the oplog. On primary, The OpTime
     * used consists of the timestamp of the latest oplog entry on disk and the current term. On
     * secondaries, lastAppliedOpTime is used. Using lastAppliedOpTime on secondaries is the desired
     * behavior, since secondaries do timestamped reads at the lastApplied.
     *
     * Setting the lastOp to the latest OpTime is necessary when doing no-op writes, as we need to
     * set the client's lastOp to a proper value for write concern wait to work.

     * An exception to this are multi-document transactions, which do a noop write at commit time
     * and advance the client's lastOp in case the transaction resulted in a no-op.
