     * Uses the oplogTruncateAfterPoint, accessed via '_consistencyMarkers', to decide whether to
     * truncate part of the oplog. If oplogTruncateAfterPoint has been set, then there may be holes

     * If the oplogTruncateAfterPoint is earlier in time than or equal to the stable timestamp, we
     * will truncate the oplog after the stable timestamp instead. There cannot be holes before a

     * oplogTruncateAfterPoint is updated on primaries by an asynchronously looping thread that can
     * potentially be starved.

     * If the stable timestamp is at a hole, this will move the stable timestamp back to the new

     * Checks if the proposed oplog application start point (which is typically derived from the

     * unchanged. If that point is not in the oplog, this function returns an entry before
     * that start point.
     * It is safe to do as as we make sure that we always keep an oplog entry that is less than
     * or equal to the stable timestamp so such a correction always pushes the start point back and
     * never forward. Applying entries from an earlier point is permissible due to oplog entry
     * idempotency (and also due to the order being preserved.)
