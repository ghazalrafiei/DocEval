     * "algorithm" is shared between the runner and the caller.
     * "logMessage" is the process for which this ScatterGatherRunner is used. It will be included
     * in log lines written by the ScatterGatherRunner for remote command requests.

     * the shutdown state before run() can schedule execution of the scatter-gather
     * in the executor.  Note that if the executor is shut down after the algorithm
     * is scheduled but before it completes, this method will return Status::OK(),
