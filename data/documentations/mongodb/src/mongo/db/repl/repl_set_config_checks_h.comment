 * Checks if the member given by the config index is electable in the new config.

['text':'*
 * Checks if two configs are the same in content, ignoring 'version' and 'term' fields.
 ','line_number':50,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Finds the index of the one member configuration in "newConfig" that corresponds
 * to the current node (as identified by "externalState").
 *
 * Returns an error if the current node does not appear or appears multiple times in
 * "newConfig".

 * Like findSelfInConfig, above, but also returns an error if the member configuration
 * for this node is not electable, as this is a requirement for nodes accepting
 * reconfig or initiate commands.
 ','line_number':66,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Does a quick pass to see whether a host exists in the new config. Not as precise as
 * findSelfInConfig.
 ','line_number':75,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Validates that "newConfig" is a legal configuration that the current
 * node can accept from its local storage during startup.
 *
 * Returns the index of the current node's member configuration in "newConfig",
 * on success, and an indicative error on failure.
 ','line_number':81,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Validates that "newConfig" is a legal initial configuration that can be
 * initiated by the current node (identified via "externalState").
 *
 * Returns the index of the current node's member configuration in "newConfig",
 * on success, and an indicative error on failure.
 ','line_number':92,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Validates that "newConfig" is a legal successor configuration to "oldConfig" that can be
 * initiated by the current node (identified via "externalState").
 *
 * If "force" is set to true, then the single node change requirement is not checked.
 *
 * If "allowSplitHorizonIP" is set to true, skips checking whether an IP address exists in
 * split horizon configuration.
 *
 * Returns an indicative error on validation failure.
 ','line_number':103,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Validates that "newConfig" is an acceptable configuration when
 * received in a heartbeat reasponse.
 *
 * If the new configuration omits the current node, but is
 * otherwise valid, returns ErrorCodes::NodeNotFound.  If the
 * configuration is wholly valid, returns Status::OK(). Otherwise,
 * returns some other error status.
