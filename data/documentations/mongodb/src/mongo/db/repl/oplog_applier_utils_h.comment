     * Sort operations by their namespaces. There are some special rules for sorting:
     *
     * 1. Prepared transaction commands (prepare/commit/abort) act as delimiters, which
     *    creates partitions in the ops vector so that any reordering can only happen
     *    within each partition but not across partitions.
     * 2. Within each partition, DDL ops (with the '$cmd' collection name) are ordered
     *    before all other CRUD ops since DDL ops need to be run before CRUD ops.
     *
     * As an example, the right side below is a possible output after calling this:
     * [                                         [
