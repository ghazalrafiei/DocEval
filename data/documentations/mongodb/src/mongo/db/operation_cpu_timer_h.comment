 * Implements the CPU timer for platforms that support CPU consumption tracking. Consider the
 * following when using the timer:
 *
 * All methods may only be invoked on the thread associated with the operation.
 *
 * To access the timer, the operation must be associated with a client, and the client must be
 * attached to the current thread.
 *
 * The timer is initially stopped, measures elapsed time between the invocations of `start()`
 * and `stop()`, and resets on consequent invocations of `start()`.
 *
 * To reset a timer, it should be stopped first and then started again.
 *
 * The timer is paused when the operation's client is detached from the current thread, and will
 * not resume until the client is reattached to a thread.
