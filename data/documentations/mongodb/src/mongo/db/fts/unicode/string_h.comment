['text':'*
 * A string class that support basic Unicode functionality such as removing diacritic marks, and
 * lowercasing. The String is constructed with UTF-8 source data, and is converted under the hood to
 * a u32string (UTF-32) so operations can be easily done with individual Unicode code points.
 ','line_number':45,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Construct a String with UTF-8 source data (supports standard C++ string literals, and
     * std::strings).
     ','line_number':54,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Reset the String with the new UTF-8 source data, reusing the underlying buffer when possible.
     ','line_number':60,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Takes a substring of the current String and puts it in another String.
     * Overwrites buffer's previous contents rather than appending.
     ','line_number':65,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Lowercases a substring of the current String and stores the UTF8 result in buffer.
     * Overwrites buffer's previous contents rather than appending.
     ','line_number':71,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Returns a UTF-8 encoded std::string version of the String instance. Uses the conversion
     * stored in the output buffer when possible.
     ','line_number':80,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Returns the number Unicode codepoints in the String.
     ','line_number':86,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Returns the Unicode codepoint at index i of the String.
     ','line_number':93,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Options for the substrMatch method.
     ','line_number':100,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * No options (case insensitive and diacritic insensitive).
     ','line_number':105,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Perform case sensitive substring match.
     ','line_number':110,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Perform diacritic sensitive substring match.
     ','line_number':115,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Search the string 'str' for the string 'find'. If 'find' exists in 'str', return true, else
     * return false. Optionally searches can be made case sensitive and diacritic insensitive. If
     * the search is case insensitive, non-Turkish case folding is used unless the
     * CaseFoldMode::Turkish is passed to mode.
     ','line_number':120,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Strips diacritics and case-folds the utf8 input string, as needed to support options.
     *
     * The options field specifies what operations to *skip*, so kCaseSensitive means to skip case
     * folding and kDiacriticSensitive means to skip diacritic striping. If both flags are
     * specified, the input utf8 StringData is returned directly without any processing or copying.
     *
     * If processing is performed, the returned StringData will be placed in buffer. buffer's
     * contents (if any) will be replaced. Since we may return the input unmodified the returned
     * StringData's lifetime is the shorter of the input utf8 and the next modification to buffer.
     * The input utf8 must not point into buffer.
     ','line_number':131,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Helper method for converting a UTF-8 string to a UTF-32 string.
     ','line_number':149,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Unified implementation of substrToBuf and toLowerToBuf.
     ','line_number':154,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * The underlying UTF-32 data.
     ','line_number':163,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * A buffer for storing the result of the UTF-32 to UTF-8 conversion.
     ','line_number':168,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * A bool flag that is set to true when toString() will require that the UTF-32 to UTF-8
     * conversion be applied again.
     ','line_number':173,'multiline':True]
