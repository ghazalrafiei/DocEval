 * A FTSLanguage represents a language for a text-indexed document or a text search.
 * FTSLanguage objects are not copyable.
 *
 * Recommended usage:
 *
 *     const auto& language = FTSLanguage::make( "en", TEXT_INDEX_VERSION_3 );
 *     if ( !lang.isOK() ) {
 *         // Error.
 *     }
 *     else {
 *         const FTSLanguage& language = swl.getValue();
 *         // Use language.
 *     }

     * Return the FTSLanguage associated with the given language string and the given text index

     * For textIndexVersion >= TEXT_INDEX_VERSION_2, language strings are
     * case-insensitive, and need to be in one of the two following forms:
     * - English name, like "spanish".
     * - Two-letter code, like "es".
     *
     * For textIndexVersion == TEXT_INDEX_VERSION_1, no validation or normalization of
     * language strings is performed.  This is necessary to preserve indexing behavior for
     * documents with language strings like "en": for compatibility, text data in these
     * documents needs to be processed with the English stemmer and the empty stopword list
     * (since "en" is recognized by Snowball but not the stopword processing logic).
