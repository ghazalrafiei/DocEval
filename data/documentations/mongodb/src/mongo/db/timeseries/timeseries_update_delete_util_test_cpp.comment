     * Runs two translations: the first is expected to succeed and the second is expected to fail.
     * Each translation can have three types of string substitutions.
     *
     * The first type of substitution, {0}, will be the metaField in both cases. On success, it is
     * expected to be translated to "meta".
     *
     * The second type of substitution, {1}, will be the metaField in the success case and will be
     * "notMetaField" in the fail case. On success, it is expected to be translated to "meta".
     *
     * The third type of substitution, {2}, will be the metaField in both cases. On success, it is
     * expected to be untranslated and still remain the metaField.
