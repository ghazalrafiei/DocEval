 * There is up to one 'config.system.preimages' collection per tenant. This pre-images
 * collection contains pre-images for every collection 'nsUUID' with pre-images enabled on the
 * tenant. The pre-images collection is ordered by collection 'nsUUID', so that pre-images belonging
 * to a given collection are grouped together. Additionally, pre-images for a given collection
 * 'nsUUID' are stored in timestamp order, which makes range truncation possible.

 * Implementation of truncate markers for pre-images associated with a single collection 'nsUUID'

     * Creates an 'InitialSetOfMarkers' from samples of pre-images with 'nsUUID'. The generated
     * markers are best-effort estimates. They do not guarantee to capture an accurate number of
     * records and bytes corresponding to the 'nsUUID' within the pre-images collection. This is
     * because size metrics are only available for an entire pre-images collection, not individual
     * segments corresponding to the provided 'nsUUID'.
     *
     * For mathamatical simplicity, the 'InitialSetOfMarkers' will only capture whole markers. Any
     * samples not captured by whole markers will not be accounted for as a partial marker in the
     * result.
