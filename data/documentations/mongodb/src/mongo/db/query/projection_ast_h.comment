 * This node behaves as a map from field name to child in a projection. Internally, we hold a vector
 * of field names until the size reaches 100, where we switch to a map type for faster searching. We
 * behave this way to avoid the overhead of a map for small queries, where the linear search is
 * faster. Note that we do not go back to using a vector if the size drops below 100 due to
 * removeChild() calls.
