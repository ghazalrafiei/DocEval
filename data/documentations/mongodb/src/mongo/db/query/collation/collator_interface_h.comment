 * An interface for ordering and matching according to a collation. Instances should be retrieved

     * Every string has a corresponding ComparisonKey with respect to this collator. Two
     * ComparisonKeys can be lexicographically ordered in order to obtain the collation's sort order
     * and equivalence classes.
     *
     * A ComparisonKey is logically an owned array of bytes. It is cheap to move but potentially
     * expensive to copy.
     *
     * ComparisonKeys may only be obtained via CollatorInterface::getComparisonKey().
     *
     * In general, two strings should be compared with respect to a collation using
     * CollatorInterface::compare(). ComparisonKey::compare() may be faster if repeatedly comparing
     * the same string(s).

         * Returns the underlying byte array represented by this ComparisonKey.
         *
         * The returned StringData may not outlive the ComparisonKey used to create it, since the
         * ComparisonKey owns the underlying byte array.

     * Constructs a CollatorInterface capable of computing the collation described by 'spec'.
     ','line_number':92,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Returns a number < 0 if 'left' is less than 'right' with respect to the collation, a number >
     * 0 if 'left' is greater than 'right' w.r.t. the collation, and 0 if 'left' and 'right' are
     * equal w.r.t. the collation.

     * Hashes the string such that strings which are equal under this collation also have equal
