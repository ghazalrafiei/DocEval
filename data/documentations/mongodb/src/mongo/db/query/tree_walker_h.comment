 * Provided with a Walker and a Node, walk() calls each of the following:
 * * walker.preVisit() once before walking to each child.
 * * walker.inVisit() between walking to each child. It is called multiple times, once between each
 *   pair of children. walker.inVisit() is skipped if the Node has fewer than two children.
 * * walker.postVisit() once after walking to each child.
 *
 * Each of the Node's children is recursively walked and the same three methods are called for it.
 *
 * The Node type should either provide begin() and end() methods returning an iterator to walk its
 * children, or define begin() and end() functions taking a Node reference which return the
 * iterator.
 *
 * If the caller doesn't intend to modify the tree, then the template argument 'IsConst' should be
 * set to 'true'. In this case the 'node' pointer will be qualified with 'const'.
