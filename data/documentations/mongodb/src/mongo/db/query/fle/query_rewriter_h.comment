 * Class which handles traversing expressions and rewriting predicates for FLE2.
 *
 * The QueryRewriter is responsible for traversing Agg Expressions and MatchExpression trees and
 * calling individual rewrites (subclasses of EncryptedPredicate) that have been registered for each
 * encrypted index type.
 *
 * The actual rewrites performed are stored in references to maps in the class. In non-test
 * environments, these are global maps that register encrypted predicate rewrites that live in their
 * own files.

     * Accepts a BSONObj holding a MatchExpression, and returns BSON representing the rewritten
     * expression. Returns boost::none if no rewriting was done.
     *
     * Rewrites the match expression with FLE find payloads into a disjunction on the
     * __safeContent__ array of tags.
     *
     * Will rewrite top-level $eq and $in expressions, as well as recursing through $and, $or, $not
     * and $nor. Also handles similarly limited rewriting under $expr. All other MatchExpressions,
     * notably $elemMatch, are ignored.

     * Accepts an expression to be re-written. Will rewrite top-level expressions including $eq and
     * $in, as well as recursing through other expressions. Returns a new pointer if the top-level
     * expression must be changed. A nullptr indicates that the modifications happened in-place.
