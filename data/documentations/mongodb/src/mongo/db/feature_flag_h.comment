 * FeatureFlag contains information about whether a feature flag is enabled and what version it was
 * released.
 *
 * FeatureFlag represents the state of a feature flag and whether it is associated with a particular
 * version. It is not implicitly convertible to bool to force all call sites to make a decision
 * about what check to use.
 *
 * It is only set at startup.

     * Returns true if the flag is set to true and enabled for this FCV version.
     * If the functionality of this function changes, make sure that the
     * isEnabled/isPresentAndEnabled functions in feature_flag_util.js also incorporate the change.
     ','line_number':64,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Returns true if the flag is set to true and enabled for this FCV version. If the FCV version
     * is unset, instead checks against the default last LTS FCV version.
     ','line_number':71,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Returns true if the flag is set to true and enabled for this FCV version. If the FCV version
     * is unset, instead checks against the latest FCV version.
     ','line_number':78,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Returns true if this flag is enabled regardless of the current FCV version. When using this
     * function, you are allowing the feature flag to pass checking during transitional FCV states
     * and downgraded FCV, which means the code gated by this feature flag is allowed to run even if
     * the FCV requirement of this feature flag is not met.
     *
     * isEnabled() is prefered over this function since it will prevent upgrade/downgrade issues,
     * or use isEnabledUseLatestFCVWhenUninitialized if your feature flag could be run while FCV is
     * uninitialized during initial sync.
     *
     * Note: A comment starting with (Ignore FCV check) is required for the use of this function.

     * Returns true if the flag is set to true and enabled on the target FCV version.

     * This function is used in the 'setFeatureCompatibilityVersion' command where the in-memory FCV
     * is in flux.

     * Returns true if the feature flag is disabled on targetFCV but enabled on originalFCV.
