 * Wraps the usersInfo and rolesInfo command args.
 *
 * These commands accept the following formats:
 *  {....sInfo: 1} // All users on the current DB.
 *  {usersInfo: {forAllDBs: 1}} // All users on all DBs. (usersInfo only)
 *
 *  {....sInfo: 'alice'} // Specific user on current DB.
 *  {....sInfo: {db: 'test', user: 'alice'} // Specific user on specific DB.
 *  {....sInfo: [stringOrDoc]} // Set of users (using above two formats)
 *
 * Use isAllOnCurrentDB(), isAllForAllDBs(), and isExact() to determine format.
 * Then use getElements(dbname) for isExact() form to get list of T names.
