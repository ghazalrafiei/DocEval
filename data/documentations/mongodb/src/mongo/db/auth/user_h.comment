 * Represents a MongoDB user.  Stores information about the user necessary for access control

 * the user belongs to.
 *
 * Every User object is owned by an AuthorizationManager.  The AuthorizationManager is the only
 * one that should construct, modify, or delete a User object.  All other consumers of User must
 * use only the const methods.  The AuthorizationManager is responsible for maintaining the
 * reference count on all User objects it gives out and must not mutate any User objects with
 * a non-zero reference count (except to call invalidate()).  Any consumer of a User object
 * should check isInvalidated() before using it, and if it has been invalidated, it should
 * return the object to the AuthorizationManager and fetch a new User object instance for this
 * user from the AuthorizationManager.
