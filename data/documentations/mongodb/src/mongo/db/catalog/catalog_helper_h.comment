 * Fills the input 'collLocks' with CollectionLocks, acquiring locks on namespaces 'nsOrUUID' and
 * 'secondaryNssOrUUIDs' in ResourceId(RESOURCE_COLLECTION, nss) order.
 *
 * The namespaces will be resolved, the locks acquired, and then the namespaces will be checked for
 * changes in case there is a race with rename and a UUID no longer matches the locked namespace.
 *
 * Handles duplicate namespaces across 'nsOrUUID' and 'secondaryNssOrUUIDs'. Only one lock will be
 * taken on each namespace.
