 * QueuedDataStage is a data-producing stage.  Unlike the other two leaf stages (CollectionScan
 * and IndexScan) QueuedDataStage does not require any underlying storage layer.
 *
 * A QueuedDataStage is "programmed" by pushing return values from work() onto its internal
 * queue.  Calls to QueuedDataStage::work() pop values off that queue and return them in FIFO
 * order, annotating the working set with data when appropriate.

     * The caller is responsible for allocating 'id' and filling out the WSM keyed by 'id'
     * appropriately.
     *
     * The QueuedDataStage takes ownership of 'id', so the caller should not call WorkingSet::free()
     * on it.
