 * Generic sorting implementation which can handle sorting any WorkingSetMember, including those
 * that have RecordIds, metadata, or which represent index keys.

['text':'*
 * Optimized sorting implementation which can be used for WorkingSetMembers in a fetched state that
 * have no metadata. This implementation is faster but less general than WorkingSetMemberSortStage.
 *
 * For performance, this implementation discards record ids and returns WorkingSetMembers in the
 * OWNED_OBJ state. Therefore, this sort implementation cannot be used if the plan requires the
 * record id to be preserved (e.g. for update or delete plans, where an ancestor stage needs to
 * refer to the record in order to perform a write).
