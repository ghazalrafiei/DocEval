 * The stage iterates all input blocks, which can be a mix of either ValueBlocks or CellBlocks, and
 * populates the corresponding output slots with the individual values from each block. Each input
 * block must be the same size.

 * This stage also takes an optional bitmapSlotId argument. When present, the bitmap slot must
 * contain a block of all booleans, identical in size to the input blocks. Values that lie at an
 * index with a corresponding '0' in the bitmap will be omitted from the output.
