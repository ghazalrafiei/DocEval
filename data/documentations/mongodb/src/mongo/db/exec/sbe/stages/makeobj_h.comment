     * Constructor. Arguments:
     * -input: Child PlanStage.
     * -objSlot: The output slot.
     *
     * -rootSlot (optional): Slot containing an object which the return object will be based on.
     * -fieldBehavior (optional): This may only be specified when 'rootSlot' is specified. Describes
     * what the behavior should be for each field in 'fields'. Either "drop" or "keep".
     * -fields: List of fields. What the stage does with each field depends on 'fieldBehavior'.
     *
     * -projectFields: List of fields which should be added to the result object using the values
     * from 'projectVars'.
     * -projectVars: See above.
     *
     * -forceNewObject, returnOldObject: Describes what the behavior should be when the resulting
     * object has no fields. May either return 'Nothing', an empty object, or the object in
     * 'rootSlot' unmodified.
     *
     * -planNodeId: Mapping to the corresponding QuerySolutionNode.
