 * Returns the elements of an array and the associated array index one-by-one. The array to unwind
 * is read from the 'inField' slot. The resulting array elements are put into the 'outField' slot
 * with the corresponding array indices available in 'outIndex'.
 *
 * Generally, if 'inField' contains a non-array value it is skipped. However, if
 * 'preserveNullAndEmptyArrays' is true then, as the name implies, null or empty arrays are
 * preserved (i.e. these values are put into the 'outField' slot and the stage returns 'ADVANCED').
