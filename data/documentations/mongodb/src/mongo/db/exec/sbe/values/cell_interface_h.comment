 * CellBlock corresponds to a path for a given document and is a container of values at a "path"
 * according to the chosen definition of "path".
 *
 * For example, a TS bucket has the "data" field that stores the actual data in a columnar format.
 * Each top-level field in the "data" field could be a CellBlock, in which case the "path"
 * definition is the top-level field name.

     * Limited version of the path language supporting only Get, Traverse, and Id.  For now paths

     * Returns an vector of true/false values with a 1 in the position for every new document. E.g.

     * {a: 5}
     * {XYZ: 999}

     *
     * Filter position info (the return value of this function):
     * [1,0,0,0,1,1       1,0]
     *
     * A '1' indicates that this value is the beginning of the next document. A '0' indicates this
     * value is part of the same document as the previous entry.
     *
     * An empty vector represents a trivial position info, ie, there are no arrays at all.

['text':'
 * Represents a single path through a block of objects. Stores all of the values found at
 * the given path with eagerly materialized projection and filter position info.
