 * The SortExecutor class is the internal implementation of sorting for query execution. The
 * caller should provide input documents by repeated calls to the add() function, and then
 * complete the loading process with a single call to loadingDone(). Finally, getNext() should be
 * called to return the documents one by one in sorted order.
 *
 * The template parameter is the type of data being sorted. In DocumentSource execution, we sort
 * Document objects directly, but in the PlanStage layer we may sort WorkingSetMembers. The type of
 * the sort key, on the other hand, is always Value.
