 * Oplog entries on 'system.views' should also be processed one at a time. View catalog immediately
 * reflects changes for each oplog entry so we can see inconsistent view catalog if multiple oplog
 * entries on 'system.views' are being applied out of the original order.
 *
 * Process updates to 'admin.system.version' individually as well so the secondary's FCV when
 * processing each operation matches the primary's when committing that operation.
 *
 * Process updates to 'config.shardMergeRecipients' individually so they serialize after
 * inserts into 'config.donatedFiles.<migrationId>'.
 *
 * Oplog entries on 'config.shards' should be processed one at a time, otherwise the in-memory state
 * that its kept on the TopologyTimeTicker might be wrong.
 *
 * Serialize updates to 'config.tenantMigrationDonors' and 'config.shardSplitDonors' to avoid races
 * with creating tenant access blockers on secondaries.
