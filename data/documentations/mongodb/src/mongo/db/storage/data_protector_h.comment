 * Performs an implementation specific transformation on a series of input buffers to
 * produce a protected form of their concatenated contents.
 *
 * protect() must be called on each input buffer, to produce a series of output buffers.
 * The caller must ensure that the output buffers are large enough to contain the protected
 * data resulting from the call. The caller must concatenate the output buffers together, in order.
 * Once all input buffers have been protect()ed, finalize() must be called, and its output
 * appended to the end of the protected data.
 * The caller may then call finalizeTag() to get implementation defined metadata.
