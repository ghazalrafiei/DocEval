 * Runs the argument function f as many times as needed for f to return an error other than
 * WT_PREPARE_CONFLICT. Each time f returns WT_PREPARE_CONFLICT we wait until the current unit of

 * re-try f, so any required timeout behavior must be enforced within f.
 * The function f must return a WiredTiger error code.
