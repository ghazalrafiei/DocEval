 * This class is used by the aggregation framework and streams enterprise module to perform the
 * document processing needed for $group.
 *
 * A caller should call the public methods of this class in the following manner:
 * - For each document, call computeGroupKey() to find its group and then add the document to the
 *   processor using the add().
 * - Once all documents are added to the processor, call readyGroups() to indicate that there are no
 *   more documents to add.
 * - Repeatedly call getNext() to get all aggregated result documents.
 * - Eventually call reset() to reset the processor to its original state.
