     * This method looks for early pipeline stages that can be folded into the underlying
     * PlanExecutor, and removes those stages from the pipeline when they can be absorbed by the
     * PlanExecutor. For example, an early $match can be removed and replaced with a
     * DocumentSourceCursor containing a PlanExecutor that will do an index scan.

     * Callers must take care to ensure that 'nss' and each collection referenced in
     * 'collections' is locked in at least IS-mode.
     *
     * When not null, 'aggRequest' provides access to pipeline command options such as hint.
     *
     * The 'collections' parameter can reference any number of collections.
     *
     * This method will not add a $cursor stage to the pipeline, but will create a PlanExecutor and
     * a callback function. The executor and the callback can later be used to create the $cursor
     * stage and add it to the pipeline by calling 'attachInnerQueryExecutorToPipeline()' method.

     * reference multiple collections may be eligible for pushdown in the PlanExecutor.

     * collections. It always pushes down the $_internalUnpackBucket source to the PlanStage layer.
