 * A $facet stage contains multiple sub-pipelines. Each input to the $facet stage will feed into
 * each of the sub-pipelines. The $facet stage is blocking, and outputs only one document,
 * containing an array of results for each sub-pipeline.
 *
 * For example, {$facet: {facetA: [{$skip: 1}], facetB: [{$limit: 1}]}} would describe a $facet
 * stage which will produce a document like the following:
 * {facetA: [<all input documents except the first one>], facetB: [<the first document>]}.
