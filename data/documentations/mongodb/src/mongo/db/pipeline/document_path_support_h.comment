 * Calls 'callback' once for each value found at 'path' in the document 'doc'. If an array value is
 * found at 'path', it is expanded and 'callback' is invoked once for each value within the array.
 *
 * For example, 'callback' will be invoked on the values 1, 1, {a: 1}, 2 and 3 are on the path "x.y"
 * in the document {x: [{y: 1}, {y: 1}, {y: {a: 1}}, {y: [2, 3]}, 3, 4]}.

 * Returns the element at 'path' in 'doc', or a missing Value if the path does not fully exist.
 *
 * Returns ErrorCodes::InternalError if an array is encountered along the path or at the end of the
 * path.

 * Extracts 'paths' from the input document and returns a BSON object containing only those paths.
 ','line_number':67,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Extracts 'paths' from the input document to a flat document.
 *
 * This does *not* traverse arrays when extracting values from dotted paths. For example, the path
 * "a.b" will not populate the result document if the input document is {a: [{b: 1}]}.
