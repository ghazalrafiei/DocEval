 * Generic histogram that supports data collection into intervals based on user-specified partitions
 * over any continuous type. A binary predicate that establishes a strict weak ordering over the
 * template parameter type `T` may be specified, otherwise `std::less<T>` is used. (read
 * more here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Compare).
 *
 * For some provided lowermost partition x and uppermost partition y, a value z will be counted
 * in the (-inf, x) interval if z < x, and in the [y, inf) interval if z >= y. If no partitions are
 * provided, z will be counted in the sole (-inf, inf) interval.

     * An input iterator over the Histogram class that provides access to histogram buckets, each
     * containing the count, lower and upper bound values. The `lower` data member set to nullptr
     * signifies the lowermost extremity of the distribution. nullptr similarly represents the
     * uppermost extremity when assigned to the `upper` data member.

 * Appends data (i.e. count and lower/upper bounds of all buckets) of a histogram to the provided
 * BSON object builder. `histKey` is used as the field name for the appended BSON object containing
