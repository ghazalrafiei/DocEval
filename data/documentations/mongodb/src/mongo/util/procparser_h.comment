 * from USER_HZ to milliseconds, and names fields with a "_ms" suffix. If the string is empty,
 * corrupt, or missing fields, the builder will simply be missing fields.
 *
 * keys - sorted vector of field names to include in the output, "cpu" will include the 11 fields

 * Read a string matching /proc/net/sockstat format, and write the relevant keys found into builder.
 * /proc/net/sockstat lines begin with a section key, like "sockets" or "TCP". The line continues

 * builder - BSON output. A sub-document for each request section is written with the requested
 * key-value pairs.
 *
 * For example, if the /proc/net/sockstat contained:
 *
 * sockets: used 299
 * TCP: inuse 8 orphan 0 tw 0 alloc 12 mem 1
 * ...
 *
 * And `keys` contained:
 *    keys["sockets"] = {"used"}
 *    keys["TCP" = {"alloc", "inuse"}
 *
 * The resulting BSONObj would look like:
