 * Returns category to use for POSIX errno error codes.
 * On POSIX, `errno` codes are the `std::system_category`.
 * On Windows, the `errno` codes are the `std::generic_category`.
 ','line_number':49,'multiline':True]
['text':'* Wraps POSIX `errno` value in an appropriate `std::error_code`. ','line_number':62,'multiline':True]

 * Returns `{errno, std::generic_category()}`.
 * Windows has both Windows errors and POSIX errors. That is, there's a
 * `GetLastError` and an `errno`. They are tracked separately, and unrelated to
 * each other.
 *
 * In practice, this function is useful only to handle the `errno`-setting POSIX
 * compatibility functions on Windows.
 *
 * On POSIX systems, `std::system_category` is potentially a superset of
 * `std::generic_category`, so `lastSystemError` should be preferred for
 * handling system errors.
 *
 * Guaranteed to not modify `errno`.

 * On POSIX, returns `{errno, std::system_category()}`.
 * On Windows, returns `{GetLastError(), std::system_category()}`, but see `lastPosixError`.

['text':'*
 * Returns `ec.message()`, possibly augmented to disambiguate unknowns.
 *
 * In libstdc++, the unknown error messages include the number. Windows and
 * Libc++ do not include it. So if the code is an unknown, it is replaced with the
 * message that libstdc++ would have given, which is the expanded format
 * expression:
 *     `"Unknown error {}"_format(ec.value())`

 * A category for `getaddrinfo` or `getnameinfo` (i.e. the netdb.h library)
 * results. Uses `gai_error` on Unix systems. On Windows, these errors are
 * compatible with the system error space.

 * Portable wrapper for socket API calls. On POSIX platforms this is just
 * `lastSystemError`. On Windows, Winsock API callers must query last error with
 * `WSAGetLastError` instead of `GetLastError`. The Winsock errors can use the
 * same error code category as other Windows API calls.
