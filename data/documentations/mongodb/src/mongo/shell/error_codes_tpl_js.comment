 * Returns true if the mongos `s` is expected to rewrite state change errors.
 * This is determined by a `getParameter` of the "rewriteStateChangeErrors" option.
 * Failure would indicate a mongos that doesn't support the rewrite feature.

 * Returns the ErrorCode to which the specified mongos `s` would remap the
 * specified `err`. Mongos normally rewrites connection state change errors,
 * unless it is shutting down or the code was injected by a mongos failpoint.
 *
 * The optional `doesRewrite` bool parameter provides a mechanism to bypass the
 * probe, which may be useful if the probe would interfere with a test's
 * operation.
