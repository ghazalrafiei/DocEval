 * MongoCollectionShardingRuntimeCheck is a custom clang-tidy check for detecting
 * the usage of CollectionShardingRuntime outside of the "mongo/db/s/" directory.
 *
 * It extends ClangTidyCheck and overrides the registerMatchers and check functions.
 * The registerMatchers function adds custom AST Matchers to detect the instances and function calls
 * of CollectionShardingRuntime. These matchers bind matched nodes with names for later retrieval in
 * check function.
 *
 * The check function then retrieves the nodes bound by the matchers and emit diagnostics if
 * any illegal usage is detected. An usage is considered illegal if the source file is not in the
 * exception directories (e.g., "src/mongo/db/s/").
