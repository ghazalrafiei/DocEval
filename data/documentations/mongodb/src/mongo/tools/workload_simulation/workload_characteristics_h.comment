 * Base class to model workload characteristics. The idea behind the approach is to specify an
 * optimal read and write concurrency level, and the throughput that is achieved by the server for
 * the workload at that concurrency level.
 *
 * A derived class must override the '_throughput' method to specify the level of throughput the
 * server will achieve for a given concurrency level. Different implementations will model the
 * throughput of the workload for different values based on some model (e.g. parabolic, piecewise
 * linear, etc.).
 *
 * The base class then derives the typical latency for an operation at a specified concurrency
 * level from the `_throughput' value. In order to make this a bit more realistic, we add some
 * jitter to the latency using a multiplier of '1 + jitter()', clamped to the range of (0.0,
 * kMaxJitterMultiplier), where jitter() returns a normally-distributed value with mean 0.0, and
 * standard deviation 'jitterDev'. If 'jitterDev' is zero, we do not add jitter to the latency.
