 * A class to record the metrics for various phases of connection establishment.
 *
 * This class expects a clock source to measure the duration of each phase of the connection
 * establishment. The clock source must always outlive instances of this class.
 *
 * The methods that record the individual phases must be called in the following order:
 * - onConnectionStarted()
 * - onDNSResolved()
 * - onTCPConnectionEstablished()
 * - onTLSHandshakeFinished()
 * - onAuthFinished()
 * - onConnectionHookFinished()
 * The calls for TLS handshake and post-auth hook can be skipped. All other calls are mandatory.
