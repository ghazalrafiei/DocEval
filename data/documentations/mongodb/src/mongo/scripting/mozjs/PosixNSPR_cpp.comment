 * This file was originally copied out of the firefox 38.0.1esr source tree from
 * `js/src/vm/PosixNSPR.cpp` and modified to use the MongoDB threading primitives.
 *
 * The point of this file is to provide dummy implementations such that when the SpiderMonkey build
 * looks for these symbols it will find symbols, thus permitting linkage.  No code uses these
 * entrypoints.
