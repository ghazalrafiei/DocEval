 * A few things to note about module resolution:
 *   - A "specifier" refers to the name of the imported module (e.g. `import {x} from 'specifier'`)
 *   - Specifiers with relative paths are always relative to their referencing module. The
 *     referencing module for the root module is the file `mongo` was run on, or the mongo binary
 *     itself when run as a REPL. In practice this means relative paths in scripts behave as you
 *     would expect relative paths to work on the command line.
 *   - If we already have source for a specifier we are trying to load (this is only the case when
 *     executing the root module), we will skip normalization and reading the source again.

The rules for baseUrl resolution are as follows:
    1. At process start determine a "loadPath" which is either the parent directory of the first
      file passed in to execute, or the current working directory.
    2. Search the loadPath for a file called "jsconfig.json", and attempt to read it as a JSON file.
    3. If found, try to find a property "compilerOptions.baseUrl" in that file and resolve that URL
      relative to the location of "jsconfig.json".
    4. If not found, loadPath is now the parent directory of loadPath, repeat steps #2-3 until
       either the baseUrl is resolved or we reach the root directory.
    5. If no baseUrl is resolved, return the current working directory
