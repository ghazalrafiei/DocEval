 * We have to do this odd dance here because we need the methods from
 * CountDownLatch to be installed in a plain object as enumerable properties.
 * This is due to the way CountDownLatch is invoked, specifically after being
 * transmitted across our js fork(). So we can't inherit and can't rely on the
 * type. Practically, we also end up wrapping up all of these functions in pure
 * js variants that call down, which makes them bson <-> js safe.
