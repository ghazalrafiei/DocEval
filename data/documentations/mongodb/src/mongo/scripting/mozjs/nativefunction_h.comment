 * Wrapper for JS Interpreter agnostic functions. Think mapReduce, or any use
 * case that can tolerate automatic json <-> bson translation.
 *
 * The business end of the shim methods comes via ::call(). These types are
 * invokable as js functions, with a little bit of automatic translation for
 * arguments.
 *
 * This inherits from the global Function type.
 *
 * Also note that installType is private. So you can only get NativeFunctions
 * in JS via ::make() from C++.
