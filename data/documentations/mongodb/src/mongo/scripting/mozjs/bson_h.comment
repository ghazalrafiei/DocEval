 * Provides a wrapper for BSONObj's in JS. The main idea here is that BSONObj's
 * can be read only, or read write when we shim them in, and in all cases we
 * lazily load their member elements into JS. So a bunch of these lifecycle
 * methods are set up to wrap field access (enumerate, resolve and
 * del/setProperty).
 *
 * Note that installType is private. So you can only get BSON types in JS via
 * ::make() from C++.
