 * Implements a stack with:
 *   o specific LIFO lifetime guarantees
 *   o builtin storage (based on template parameter)
 *
 * This is useful for manipulating stacks of types which are non-movable and
 * non-copyable (and thus cannot be put into standard containers). The lack of
 * an allocator additionally supports types that must live in particular
 * region of memory (like the stack vs. the heap).
 *
 * We need this to store GC Rooting types from spidermonkey safely.
