 * Helper for handling the `hello` command on mongos.

 * `loadBalanced` option present and set to `true`.
 *
 * For only the initial `hello` command, we respond to a `loadBalanced: true`
 * option by including the `serviceId` of this mongos in the hello reply.

 * A connection marked as having come in through a load balancer must confirm
 * that it is using a load-balancer-aware driver by setting the `loadBalanced:
 * true` option in its first `hello` command. Otherwise, this function will
 * throw with `ErrorCodes::LoadBalancerSupportMismatch`.
