     * Changes the shard key for the document if the response object contains a
     * WouldChangeOwningShard error. If the original command was sent as a retryable write, starts a
     * transaction on the same session and txnNum, deletes the original document, inserts the new
     * one, and commits the transaction. If the original command is part of a transaction, deletes
     * the original document and inserts the new one. Returns whether or not we actually complete
     * the delete and insert.
