     * These two methods use the sharding routing metadata to do a best effort attempt at grouping
     * the specified set of sessions by the shards, which have the records for these sessions. This
     * is done as an attempt to avoid broadcast queries.
     *
     * The reason it is 'best effort' is because it makes no attempt at checking whether the routing
     * table is up-to-date and just picks up whatever was most recently fetched from the config
     * server, which could be stale.
