 * This error is thrown when an update would cause a document to be owned by a different
 * shard. If the update is part of a multi statement transaction, we will attach the
 * pre image and the post image returned by the update stage. MongoS will use these to delete
 * the original doc and insert the new doc. If the update is a retryable write, we will attach
 * only the pre image.
