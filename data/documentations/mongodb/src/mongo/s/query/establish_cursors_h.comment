 * Establishes cursors on the remote shards by issuing requests in parallel, using the readPref to
 * select a host within each shard.
 *
 * If any of the cursors fail to be established, this function performs cleanup by sending
 * killCursors to any cursors that were established, then throws the error. If the namespace
 * represents a view, an exception containing a ResolvedView is thrown. Calling code can then
 * attempt to establish cursors against the base collection using this view.
 *
 * On success, the ownership of the cursors is transferred to the caller. This means the caller is
 * now responsible for either exhausting the cursors or sending killCursors to them.
 *
 * If providedOpKeys are given, this assumes all requests have been given an operation key and will
 * use the provided keys to kill operations on failure. Otherwise a unique operation key is
 * generated and attached to all requests.
 *
 * @param allowPartialResults: If true, unreachable hosts are ignored, and only cursors established
 *                             on reachable hosts are returned.
