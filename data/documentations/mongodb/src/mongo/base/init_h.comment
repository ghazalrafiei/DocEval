 * Utility macros for declaring global initializers
 *
 * Should NOT be included by other header files.  Include only in source files.
 *
 * Initializers are arranged in an acyclic directed dependency graph.  Declaring
 * a cycle will lead to a runtime error.
 *
 * Initializer functions take a parameter of type ::mongo::InitializerContext*.
 * They throw to indicate failure, stopping further intializer processing.

 * Macro to define an initializer function named "NAME" with the default
 * prerequisite set, that is `("default")`, and no explicit dependents.
 *
 * The default set of prerequisites for initializer functions has one member,
 * called "default". It refers to a do-nothing initializer called "default"
 * defined by this init system, which serves as a partition point. It splits
 * the graph into two broad phases. In practice, most initializers can omit
 * their prerequisites and dependents, and use the MONGO_INITIALIZER macro, and
 * such rules will be constrained to occur _after_ the "default" sequence
 * point. Some special rules perform early preparation like options parsing,
 * and several initializers might depend on these, so they will typically
 * specify that they happen _before_ the "default" sequence point.
 *
 * The pre-"default" phase is further broken down into an orderly series of
 * internal stages. (See util/options_parser/startup_option_init.cpp).
 *
 * See MONGO_INITIALIZER_GENERAL.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     MONGO_INITIALIZER(myModule)(::mongo::InitializerContext* context) {
 *         ...
 *     }

 * Macro to define an initializer function named "NAME" that depends on the initializers

 *     MONGO_INITIALIZER_WITH_PREREQUISITES(myGlobalStateChecker,

 * Macro to define an initializer that depends on PREREQUISITES and has DEPENDENTS as explicit
 * dependents.
 *
 * NAME is any legitimate name for a C++ symbol.
 * PREREQUISITES is a tuple of strings surrounded by parens, e.g., ("a", "b", "c"), or ().
 * DEPENDENTS is a tuple of strings surrounded by parens.
 *
 * At run time, the full set of prerequisites for NAME will be computed as the union of the
 * explicit PREREQUISITES and the set of all other mongo initializers that name NAME in their
 * list of DEPENDENTS.
 *
 * Usage:
 *    MONGO_INITIALIZER_GENERAL(myInitializer,
 *                             ("myPrereq1", "myPrereq2", ...),
 *                             ("myDependent1", "myDependent2", ...))(
 *            ::mongo::InitializerContext* context) {
 *    }
 *
 * TODO: May want to be able to name the initializer separately from the function name.
 * A form that takes an existing function or that lets the programmer supply the name
 * of the function to declare would be options.

 * Macro to define an initializer group.
 *
 * An initializer group is an initializer that performs no actions.  It is useful for organizing
 * initialization steps into phases, such as "all global parameter declarations completed", "all

     *         A deinitialization that will execute in reverse order from initialization and
     *         support re-initialization. If not specified, defaults to `nullptr`.
     *         Example expression:

     *     - std::vector<std::string> prerequisites
     *         If not specified, defaults to {"default"}.

     *     - std::vector<std::string> dependents
     *         If not specified, defaults to {} (no dependents).
     *
     *
     * At run time, the full set of prerequisites for `name` will be computed as the union of the
     * `prerequisites` (which can be defaulted) and all other mongo initializers that list `name` in
     * their `dependents`.
     *
     * A non-null `deinitFn` will tag the initializer as supporting re-initialization.
