 * This program runs the Server Discover and Monitoring JSON test files located in
 * the src/monogo/client/sdam/json_tests/sdam_tests sub-directory.
 *
 * The process return code conforms to the UNIX idiom of 0 to indicate success and non-zero to
 * indicate failure. In the case of test failure, the process will return the number of test cases
 * that failed.
 *
 * Example invocation to run all tests:
 *  sdam_json_test --source-dir src/monogo/client/sdam/json_tests/sdam_tests
 *
 * Example invocation to run a single test:
 *  sdam_json_test --source-dir src/monogo/client/sdam/json_tests/sdam_tests --filter
 * normalize_uri_case
