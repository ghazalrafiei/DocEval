 * Attempts to authenticate "client" using the SASL protocol.
 *
 * Do not use directly in client code.  Use the auth::authenticateClient() method, instead.
 *
 * Test against NULL for availability.  Client driver must be compiled with SASL support _and_
 * client application must have successfully executed mongo::runGlobalInitializersOrDie() or its
 * ilk to make this functionality available.
 *
 * The "saslParameters" BSONObj should be initialized with zero or more of the
 * fields below.  Which fields are required depends on the mechanism.  Consult the
 * relevant IETF standards.
 *
 *     "mechanism": The std::string name of the sasl mechanism to use.  Mandatory.
 *     "autoAuthorize": Truthy values tell the server to automatically acquire privileges on
 *         all resources after successful authentication, which is the default.  Falsey values
 *         instruct the server to await separate privilege-acquisition commands.
 *     "user": The std::string name of the user to authenticate.
 *     "db": The database target of the auth command, which identifies the location
 *         of the credential information for the user.  May be "$external" if credential
 *         information is stored outside of the mongo cluster.
 *     "pwd": The password.
 *     "serviceName": The GSSAPI service name to use.  Defaults to "mongodb".
 *     "serviceHostname": The GSSAPI hostname to use.  Defaults to the name of the remote host.
 *
 * Other fields in saslParameters are silently ignored.
 *
 * Returns an OK status on success, and ErrorCodes::AuthenticationFailed if authentication is
 * rejected.  Other failures, all of which are tantamount to authentication failure, may also be
 * returned.

 * Extracts the payload field from "cmdObj", and store it into "*payload".

 * If the type of the payload field is String, the contents base64 decodes and
 * stores into "*payload".  If the type is BinData, the contents are stored directly
 * into "*payload".  In all other cases, returns
