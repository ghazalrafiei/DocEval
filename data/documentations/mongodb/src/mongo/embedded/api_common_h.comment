 * A status object for use with C APIs that call into C++ code. When using StatusForAPI for error
 * reporting, call any C++ within an enterCXX() block, which can translate exceptions into
 * StatusForApi objects by way of handleException().
 *
 * The ErrorEnum type parameter is a C enum with error codes that will be exposed to the clients of
 * the C interface. This enum _must_ include a value that maps to 0, which will be the default value
 * for a clean Status object (usually indicating success).
