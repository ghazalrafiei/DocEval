 * scheduled during the execution of that top-level task as it runs on such a
 * worker thread are pushed to the queue of that worker thread.

 * Thus, the top-level task is expected to represent a chain of operations, each

 * Behaves similarly to ServiceExecutorSynchronous above,

 * Thus, unlike ServiceExecutorSynchronous, the initial call to TaskRunner::schedule()
 * will appear to block on the entire queue of Tasks until completion.
