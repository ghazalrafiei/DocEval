 * A NetworkingBaton is basically a networking reactor, with limited functionality and parallel
 * forward progress guarantees.  Rather than asynchronously running tasks through one, the baton
 * records the intent of those tasks and defers waiting and execution to a later call to run();
 *
 * NetworkingBaton's provide a mechanism to allow consumers of a transport layer to execute IO
 * themselves, rather than having this occur on another thread.  This can improve performance by
 * minimizing context switches, as well as improving the readability of stack traces by grounding
 * async execution on top of a regular client call stack.
