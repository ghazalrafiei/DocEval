 *
 * <h2>Regular Expression API</h2>
 *
 * <p>The ICU API for processing regular expressions consists of two classes,
 *  <code>RegexPattern</code> and <code>RegexMatcher</code>.
 *  <code>RegexPattern</code> objects represent a pre-processed, or compiled
 *  regular expression.  They are created from a regular expression pattern string,
 *  and can be used to create <code>RegexMatcher</code> objects for the pattern.</p>
 *
 * <p>Class <code>RegexMatcher</code> bundles together a regular expression
 *  pattern and a target string to which the search pattern will be applied.
 *  <code>RegexMatcher</code> includes API for doing plain find or search
 *  operations, for search and replace operations, and for obtaining detailed
 *  information about bounds of a match. </p>
 *
 * <p>Note that by constructing <code>RegexMatcher</code> objects directly from regular
 * expression pattern strings application code can be simplified and the explicit
 * need for <code>RegexPattern</code> objects can usually be eliminated.
 * </p>

  * Class <code>RegexPattern</code> represents a compiled regular expression.  It includes
  * factory methods for creating a RegexPattern object from the source (string) form
  * of a regular expression, methods for creating RegexMatchers that allow the pattern
  * to be applied to input text, and a few convenience methods for simple common
  * uses of regular expressions.

  * <p>Class RegexPattern is not intended to be subclassed.</p>
