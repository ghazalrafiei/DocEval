 * A set of rules for a <code>RuleBasedTransliterator</code>.

['text':'*
     * Vector of rules, in the order added.  This is used while the
     * rule set is getting built.  After that, freeze() reorders and
     * indexes the rules into rules[].  Any given rule is stored once
     * in ruleVector, and one or more times in rules[].  ruleVector
     * owns and deletes the rules.
     ','line_number':35,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Sorted and indexed table of rules.  This is created by freeze()
     * from the rules in ruleVector.  It contains alias pointers to
     * the rules in ruleVector.  It is zero before freeze() is called
     * and non-zero thereafter.
     ','line_number':44,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Index table.  For text having a first character c, compute x = c&0xFF.
     * Now use rules[index[x]..index[x+1]-1].  This index table is created by
     * freeze().  Before freeze() is called it contains garbage.

     * @param status    Output parameter filled in with success or failure status.

     * Change the data object that this rule belongs to.  Used
     * internally by the TransliterationRuleData copy constructor.
     * @param data    the new data value to be set.

     * Add a rule to this set.  Rules are added in order, and order is
     * significant.  The last call to this method must be followed by
     * a call to <code>freeze()</code> before the rule set is used.
     * This method must <em>not</em> be called after freeze() has been
     * called.

     * @param adoptedRule the rule to add

     * Check this for masked rules and index it to optimize performance.
     * The sequence of operations is: (1) add rules to a set using
     * <code>addRule()</code>; (2) freeze the set using
     * <code>freeze()</code>; (3) use the rule set.  If
     * <code>addRule()</code> is called after calling this method, it
     * invalidates this object, and this method must be called again.
     * That is, <code>freeze()</code> may be called multiple times,
     * although for optimal performance it shouldn't be.
     * @param parseError A pointer to UParseError to receive information about errors
     *                   occurred.
     * @param status     Output parameter filled in with success or failure status.

     * Transliterate the given text with the given UTransPosition
     * indices.  Return TRUE if the transliteration should continue
     * or FALSE if it should halt (because of a U_PARTIAL_MATCH match).
     * Note that FALSE is only ever returned if isIncremental is TRUE.
     * @param text the text to be transliterated
     * @param index the position indices, which will be updated
     * @param isIncremental if TRUE, assume new text may be inserted
     * at index.limit, and return FALSE if thre is a partial match.
     * @return TRUE unless a U_PARTIAL_MATCH has been obtained,
     * indicating that transliteration should stop until more text
     * arrives.

     * Create rule strings that represents this rule set.
     * @param result string to receive the rule strings.  Current

     * @return    A reference to 'result'.

     * (getTarget=false) or emitted (getTarget=true) by this set.
