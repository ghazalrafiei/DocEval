 * Helper class for frozen UnicodeSets, implements contains() and span()
 * optimized for BMP code points. Structured to be UTF-8-friendly.
 *
 * ASCII: Look up bytes.
 * 2-byte characters: Bits organized vertically.
 * 3-byte characters: Use zero/one/mixed data per 64-block in U+0000..U+FFFF,
 *                    with mixed for illegal ranges.
 * Supplementary characters: Call contains() on the parent set.

     * Span the initial substring for which each character c has spanCondition==contains(c).
     * It must be s<limit and spanCondition==0 or 1.
     * @return The string pointer which limits the span.

['text':'
     * Span the trailing substring for which each character c has spanCondition==contains(c).
     * It must be s<limit and spanCondition==0 or 1.
     * @return The string pointer which starts the span.

     * Span the initial substring for which each character c has spanCondition==contains(c).
     * It must be length>0 and spanCondition==0 or 1.
     * @return The string pointer which limits the span.

     * Span the trailing substring for which each character c has spanCondition==contains(c).
     * It must be length>0 and spanCondition==0 or 1.

     * Same as UnicodeSet::findCodePoint(UChar32 c) const except that the
     * binary search is restricted for finding code points in a certain range.
     *
     * For restricting the search for finding in the range start..end,
     * pass in
     *   lo=findCodePoint(start) and
     *   hi=findCodePoint(end)
     * with 0<=lo<=hi<len.
     * findCodePoint(c) defaults to lo=0 and hi=len-1.
     *
     * @param c a character in a subrange of MIN_VALUE..MAX_VALUE
     * @param lo The lowest index to be returned.
     * @param hi The highest index to be returned.
     * @return the smallest integer i in the range lo..hi,
     *         inclusive, such that c < list[i]

     * One byte per ASCII character, or trail byte in lead position.
     * 0 or 1 for ASCII characters.
     * The value for trail bytes is the result of contains(FFFD)
     * for faster validity checking at runtime.

     * One bit per code point from U+0000..U+07FF.

     * correspond to the same bit positions in consecutive table words.
     * With code point parts
     *   lead=c{10..6}
     *   trail=c{5..0}
     * it is set.contains(c)==(table7FF[trail] bit lead)

     * Bits for 0..7F (non-shortest forms) are set to the result of contains(FFFD)
     * for faster validity checking at runtime.
     ','line_number':104,'multiline':True]
['text':'
     * One bit per 64 BMP code points.
     * The bits are organized vertically; consecutive 64-code point blocks
     * correspond to the same bit position in consecutive table words.
     * With code point parts
     *   lead=c{15..12}
     *   t1=c{11..6}
     * test bits (lead+16) and lead in bmpBlockBits[t1].
     * If the upper bit is 0, then the lower bit indicates if contains(c)
     * for all code points in the 64-block.
     * If the upper bit is 1, then the block is mixed and set.contains(c)
     * must be called.

     * Bits for 0..7FF (non-shortest forms) and D800..DFFF are set to
