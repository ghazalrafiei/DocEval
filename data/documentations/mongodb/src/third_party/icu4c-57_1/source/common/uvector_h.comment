['text':'*
 * <p>Ultralightweight C++ implementation of a <tt>void*</tt> vector
 * that is (mostly) compatible with java.util.Vector.
 *
 * <p>This is a very simple implementation, written to satisfy an
 * immediate porting need.  As such, it is not completely fleshed out,
 * and it aims for simplicity and conformity.  Nonetheless, it serves
 * its purpose (porting code from java that uses java.util.Vector)
 * well, and it could be easily made into a more robust vector class.
 *
 * <p><b>Design notes</b>
 *
 * <p>There is index bounds checking, but little is done about it.  If
 * indices are out of bounds, either nothing happens, or zero is
 * returned.  We <em>do</em> avoid indexing off into the weeds.
 *
 * <p>There is detection of out of memory, but the handling is very
 * coarse-grained -- similar to UnicodeString's protocol, but even
 * coarser.  The class contains <em>one static flag</em> that is set
 * when any call to <tt>new</tt> returns zero.  This allows the caller
 * to use several vectors and make just one check at the end to see if
 * a memory failure occurred.  This is more efficient than making a
 * check after each call on each vector when doing many operations on
 * multiple vectors.  The single static flag works best when memory
 * failures are infrequent, and when recovery options are limited or
 * nonexistent.
 *
 * <p>Since we don't have garbage collection, UVector was given the
 * option to <em>own</em>its contents.  To employ this, set a deleter
 * function.  The deleter is called on a void* pointer when that
 * pointer is released by the vector, either when the vector itself is
 * destructed, or when a call to setElementAt() overwrites an element,
 * or when a call to remove() or one of its variants explicitly
 * removes an element.  If no deleter is set, or the deleter is set to
 * zero, then it is assumed that the caller will delete elements as
 * needed.
 *
 * <p>In order to implement methods such as contains() and indexOf(),
 * UVector needs a way to compare objects for equality.  To do so, it
 * uses a comparison function, or "comparer."  If the comparer is not
 * set, or is set to zero, then all such methods will act as if the
 * vector contains no element.  That is, indexOf() will always return
 * -1, contains() will always return FALSE, etc.
 *
 * <p><b>To do</b>
 *
 * <p>Improve the handling of index out of bounds errors.
