     * The resulting set is a superset of the input for the code points but
     * not for the strings.
     * It performs a case mapping closure of the code points and adds
     * full case folding strings for the code points, and reduces strings of
     * the original set to their full case folding equivalents.
     *
     * This is designed for case-insensitive matches, for example
     * in regular expressions. The full code point case closure allows checking of
     * an input character directly against the closure set.
     * Strings are matched by comparing the case-folded form from the closure
     * set with an incremental case folding of the string in question.
     *
     * The closure set will also contain single code points if the original
     * set contained case-equivalent strings (like U+00DF for "ss" or "Ss" etc.).
     * This is not necessary (that is, redundant) for the above matching method
     * but results in the same closure sets regardless of whether the original
     * set contained the code point or a string.

 * Argument values for whether span() and similar functions continue while
 * the current character is contained vs. not contained in the set.
 *
 * The functionality is straightforward for sets with only single code points,
 * without strings (which is the common case):
 * - USET_SPAN_CONTAINED and USET_SPAN_SIMPLE work the same.
 * - USET_SPAN_CONTAINED and USET_SPAN_SIMPLE are inverses of USET_SPAN_NOT_CONTAINED.
 * - span() and spanBack() partition any string the same way when
 *   alternating between span(USET_SPAN_NOT_CONTAINED) and
 *   span(either "contained" condition).
 * - Using a complemented (inverted) set and the opposite span conditions
 *   yields the same results.
 *
 * When a set contains multi-code point strings, then these statements may not
 * be true, depending on the strings in the set (for example, whether they
 * overlap with each other) and the string that is processed.
 * For a set with strings:
 * - The complement of the set contains the opposite set of code points,
 *   but the same set of strings.
 *   Therefore, complementing both the set and the span conditions
 *   may yield different results.
 * - When starting spans at different positions in a string
 *   (span(s, ...) vs. span(s+1, ...)) the ends of the spans may be different
 *   because a set string may start before the later position.
 * - span(USET_SPAN_SIMPLE) may be shorter than
 *   span(USET_SPAN_CONTAINED) because it will not recursively try
 *   all possible paths.
 *   For example, with a set which contains the three strings "xy", "xya" and "ax",
 *   span("xyax", USET_SPAN_CONTAINED) will return 4 but
 *   span("xyax", USET_SPAN_SIMPLE) will return 3.
 *   span(USET_SPAN_SIMPLE) will never be longer than
 *   span(USET_SPAN_CONTAINED).
 * - With either "contained" condition, span() and spanBack() may partition
 *   a string in different ways.
 *   For example, with a set which contains the two strings "ab" and "ba",
 *   and when processing the string "aba",
 *   span() will yield contained/not-contained boundaries of { 0, 2, 3 }
 *   while spanBack() will yield boundaries of { 0, 1, 3 }.
 *
 * Note: If it is important to get the same boundaries whether iterating forward
 * or backward through a string, then either only span() should be used and
 * the boundaries cached for backward operation, or an ICU BreakIterator
 * could be used.
 *
 * Note: Unpaired surrogates are treated like surrogate code points.
 * Similarly, set strings match only on code point boundaries,
 * never in the middle of a surrogate pair.
 * Illegal UTF-8 sequences are treated like U+FFFD.
 * When processing UTF-8 strings, malformed set strings
 * (strings with unpaired surrogates which cannot be converted to UTF-8)
 * are ignored.
