 ','line_number':14,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * A concrete subclass of CharacterIterator that iterates over the
 * characters (code units or code points) in a UChar array.
 * It's possible not only to create an
 * iterator that iterates over an entire UChar array, but also to
 * create one that iterates over only a subrange of a UChar array
 * (iterators over different subranges of the same UChar array don't
 * compare equal).
 * @see CharacterIterator
 * @see ForwardCharacterIterator
 * @stable ICU 2.0

   * text is only aliased, not adopted (the
   * destructor will not delete it).
   * @param textPtr The UChar array to be iterated over
   * @param length The length of the UChar array
