  This code attempts to detect the Windows time zone, as set in the
  Windows Date and Time control panel.  It attempts to work on
  multiple flavors of Windows (9x, Me, NT, 2000, XP) and on localized
  installs.  It works by directly interrogating the registry and
  comparing the data there with the data returned by the
  GetTimeZoneInformation API, along with some other strategies.  The
  registry contains time zone data under one of two keys (depending on
  the flavor of Windows):

    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\
    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\

  Under this key are several subkeys, one for each time zone.  These
  subkeys are named "Pacific" on Win9x/Me and "Pacific Standard Time"
  on WinNT/2k/XP.  There are some other wrinkles; see the code for
  details.  The subkey name is NOT LOCALIZED, allowing us to support
  localized installs.

  Under the subkey are data values.  We care about:

    Std   Standard time display name, localized
    TZI   Binary block of data

  The TZI data is of particular interest.  It contains the offset, two
  more offsets for standard and daylight time, and the start and end
  rules.  This is the same data returned by the GetTimeZoneInformation
  API.  The API may modify the data on the way out, so we have to be
  careful, but essentially we do a binary comparison against the TZI
  blocks of various registry keys.  When we find a match, we know what
  time zone Windows is set to.  Since the registry key is not
  localized, we can then translate the key through a simple table
  lookup into the corresponding ICU time zone.

  This strategy doesn't always work because there are zones which
  share an offset and rules, so more than one TZI block will match.
  For example, both Tokyo and Seoul are at GMT+9 with no DST rules;
  their TZI blocks are identical.  For these cases, we fall back to a
  name lookup.  We attempt to match the display name as stored in the
  registry for the current zone to the display name stored in the
  registry for various Windows zones.  By comparing the registry data
  directly we avoid conversion complications.
