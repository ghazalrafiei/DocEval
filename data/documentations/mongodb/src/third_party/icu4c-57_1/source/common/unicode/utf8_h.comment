 * \brief C API: 8-bit Unicode handling macros
 * 
 * This file defines macros to deal with 8-bit Unicode (UTF-8) code units (bytes) and strings.
 *
 * For more information see utf.h and the ICU User Guide Strings chapter
 * (http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings).
 *
 * <em>Usage:</em>
 * ICU coding guidelines for if() statements should be followed when using these macros.
 * Compound statements (curly braces {}) must be used  for if-else-while... 
 * bodies and all macro statements should be terminated with semicolon.
