 * We put a skippable frame before each frame.
 * It contains a skippable frame magic number, the size of the skippable frame,
 * and the size of the next frame.
 * Each skippable frame is exactly 12 bytes in little endian format.
 * The first 8 bytes are for compatibility with the ZSTD format.
 * If we have N threads, the output will look like
 *
 * [0x184D2A50|4|size1] [frame1 of size size1]
 * [0x184D2A50|4|size2] [frame2 of size size2]
 * ...
 * [0x184D2A50|4|sizeN] [frameN of size sizeN]
 *
 * Each sizeX is 4 bytes.
 *
 * These skippable frames should allow us to skip through the compressed file
 * and only load at most N pages.
