['text':' PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

  deserialization. In order to ensure that the serialized data stream is always 
  the same for the same pattern, set them to zero here. We can't assume the 
  copy of the pattern is correctly aligned for accessing the fields as part of 
  a structure. Note the use of sizeof(void *) in the second of these, to
  specify the size of a pointer. If sizeof(uint8_t *) is used (tables is a 
  pointer to uint8_t), gcc gives a warning because the first argument is also a 
  pointer to uint8_t. Casting the first argument to (void *) can stop this, but 
  it didn't stop Coverity giving the same complaint. ','line_number':132,'multiline':True]
