*           PCRE2 DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM          *
************************************************','line_number':1,'multiline':True]
['text':' This is a demonstration program to illustrate a straightforward way of
using the PCRE2 regular expression library from a C program. See the
pcre2sample documentation for a short discussion ("man pcre2sample" if you have
the PCRE2 man pages installed). PCRE2 is a revised API for the library, and is
incompatible with the original PCRE API.

There are actually three libraries, each supporting a different code unit
width. This demonstration program uses the 8-bit library. The default is to
process each code unit as a separate character, but if the pattern begins with
"(*UTF)", both it and the subject are treated as UTF-8 strings, where
characters may occupy multiple code units.

In Unix-like environments, if PCRE2 is installed in your standard system
libraries, you should be able to compile this program using this command:

cc -Wall pcre2demo.c -lpcre2-8 -o pcre2demo

If PCRE2 is not installed in a standard place, it is likely to be installed
with support for the pkg-config mechanism. If you have pkg-config, you can
compile this program using this command:

cc -Wall pcre2demo.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs libpcre2-8` -o pcre2demo

If you do not have pkg-config, you may have to use something like this:

cc -Wall pcre2demo.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib \
  -R/usr/local/lib -lpcre2-8 -o pcre2demo

Replace "/usr/local/include" and "/usr/local/lib" with wherever the include and
library files for PCRE2 are installed on your system. Only some operating
systems (Solaris is one) use the -R option.

Building under Windows:

If you want to statically link this program against a non-dll .a file, you must
define PCRE2_STATIC before including pcre2.h, so in this environment, uncomment
the following line. ','line_number':5,'multiline':True]
['text':' #define PCRE2_STATIC ','line_number':43,'multiline':True]
['text':' The PCRE2_CODE_UNIT_WIDTH macro must be defined before including pcre2.h.
For a program that uses only one code unit width, setting it to 8, 16, or 32
makes it possible to use generic function names such as pcre2_compile(). Note
that just changing 8 to 16 (for example) is not sufficient to convert this
program to process 16-bit characters. Even in a fully 16-bit environment, where
string-handling functions such as strcmp() and printf() work with 16-bit
characters, the code for handling the table of named substrings will still need
to be modified. ','line_number':45,'multiline':True]
['text':'*************************************************************************

* setting up unusual interface requirements for compiling and matching,   *
* such as custom memory managers and non-standard newline definitions.    *
* This program does not do any of this, so it makes no use of contexts,   *
* always passing NULL where a context could be given.                     *

['text':'*************************************************************************
* First, sort out the command line. There is only one possible option at  *
* the moment, "-g" to request repeated matching to find all occurrences,  *
* like Perl's /g option. We set the variable find_all to a non-zero value *
* if the -g option is present.                                            *

['text':' Pattern and subject are char arguments, so they can be straightforwardly
cast to PCRE2_SPTR because we are working in 8-bit code units. The subject
length is cast to PCRE2_SIZE for completeness, though PCRE2_SIZE is in fact
defined to be size_t. ','line_number':123,'multiline':True]

* further matching is needed, it will be done below. Before running the  *
* match we must set up a match_data block for holding the result. Using  *
* pcre2_match_data_create_from_pattern() ensures that the block is       *
* exactly the right size for the number of capturing parentheses in the  *
* pattern. If you need to know the actual size of a match_data block as  *
* a number of bytes, you can find it like this:                          *

['text':'************************************************************************
* If the "-g" option was given on the command line, we want to continue  *
* to search for additional matches in the subject string, in a similar   *
* way to the /g option in Perl. This turns out to be trickier than you   *
* might think because of the possibility of matching an empty string.    *
* What happens is as follows:                                            *
*                                                                        *
* If the previous match was NOT for an empty string, we can just start   *
* the next match at the end of the previous one.                         *
*                                                                        *
* If the previous match WAS for an empty string, we can't do that, as it *
* would lead to an infinite loop. Instead, a call of pcre2_match() is    *
* made with the PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART and PCRE2_ANCHORED flags set. The *
* first of these tells PCRE2 that an empty string at the start of the    *
* subject is not a valid match; other possibilities must be tried. The   *
* second flag restricts PCRE2 to one match attempt at the initial string *
* position. If this match succeeds, an alternative to the empty string   *
* match has been found, and we can print it and proceed round the loop,  *
* advancing by the length of whatever was found. If this match does not  *
* succeed, we still stay in the loop, advancing by just one character.   *
* In UTF-8 mode, which can be set by (*UTF) in the pattern, this may be  *
* more than one byte.                                                    *
*                                                                        *
* However, there is a complication concerned with newlines. When the     *
* newline convention is such that CRLF is a valid newline, we must       *
* advance by two characters rather than one. The newline convention can  *
* be set in the regex by (*CR), etc.; if not, we must find the default.  *

['text':' If the previous match was not an empty string, there is one tricky case to
  consider. If a pattern contains \K within a lookbehind assertion at the
  start, the end of the matched string can be at the offset where the match
  started. Without special action, this leads to a loop that keeps on matching
  the same substring. We must detect this case and arrange to move the start on

  Perl does: advance the matching position by one character, and continue. We
  do this by setting the "end of previous match" offset, because that is picked
  up at the top of the loop as the point at which to start again.
