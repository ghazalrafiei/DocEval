['text':'************************************************
*      Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions       *

['text':' PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

['text':' This module contains an internal function that is used to match an extended
class. It is used by pcre2_auto_possessify() and by both pcre2_match() and
pcre2_def_match(). ','line_number':41,'multiline':True]

************************************************','line_number':53,'multiline':True]
['text':' This function is called to match a character against an extended class that
might contain codepoints above 255 and/or Unicode properties.

Arguments:
  c           the character
  data        points to the flag code unit of the XCLASS data
  utf         TRUE if in UTF mode

Returns:      TRUE if character matches, else FALSE
','line_number':57,'multiline':True]
['text':' In 8 bit mode, this must always be TRUE. Help the compiler to know that. ','line_number':75,'multiline':True]
['text':' Code points < 256 are matched against a bitmap, if one is present. If not,
we still carry on, because there may be ranges that start below 256 in the
additional data. ','line_number':79,'multiline':True]
['text':' char found ','line_number':92,'multiline':True]
['text':' First skip the bit map if present. Then match against the list of Unicode
properties or large chars or ranges that end with a large char. We won't ever
encounter XCL_PROP or XCL_NOTPROP when UTF support is not compiled. ','line_number':95,'multiline':True]

['text':' Perl space used to exclude VT, but from Perl 5.18 it is included,
      which means that Perl space and POSIX space are now identical. PCRE
      was changed at release 8.34. ','line_number':176,'multiline':True]
['text':' Perl space ','line_number':180,'multiline':True]
['text':' POSIX space ','line_number':181,'multiline':True]
['text':' The following three properties can occur only in an XCLASS, as there
      is no \p or \P coding for them. ','line_number':228,'multiline':True]
['text':' Graphic character. Implement this as not Z (space or separator) and
      not C (other), except for Cf (format) with a few exceptions. This seems
      to be what Perl does. The exceptional characters are:

      U+061C           Arabic Letter Mark
      U+180E           Mongolian Vowel Separator
      U+2066 - U+2069  Various "isolate"s
      ','line_number':231,'multiline':True]
['text':' Printable character: same as graphic, with the addition of Zs, i.e.
      not Zl and not Zp, and U+180E. ','line_number':249,'multiline':True]
['text':' Punctuation: all Unicode punctuation, plus ASCII characters that
      Unicode treats as symbols rather than punctuation, for Perl
      compatibility (these are $+<=>^`|~). ','line_number':262,'multiline':True]
['text':' This should never occur, but compilers may mutter if there is no
      default. ','line_number':272,'multiline':True]
['text':' Avoid compiler warning ','line_number':282,'multiline':True]
['text':' SUPPORT_UNICODE ','line_number':283,'multiline':True]
['text':' char did not match ','line_number':286,'multiline':True]
['text':' End of pcre2_xclass.c ','line_number':289,'multiline':True]
