['text':' The PRIV(utt)[] table below translates Unicode property names into type and
code values. It is searched by binary chop, so must be in collating sequence of
name. Originally, the table contained pointers to the name strings in the first
field of each entry. However, that leads to a large number of relocations when
a shared library is dynamically loaded. A significant reduction is made by
putting all the names into a single, large string and using offsets instead.
All letters are lower cased, and underscores are removed, in accordance with
the "loose matching" rules that Unicode advises and Perl uses. ','line_number':47,'multiline':True]
