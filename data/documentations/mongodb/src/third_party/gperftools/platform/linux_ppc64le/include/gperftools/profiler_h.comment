 * Module for CPU profiling based on periodic pc-sampling.
 *
 * For full(er) information, see docs/cpuprofile.html
 *
 * This module is linked into your program with
 * no slowdown caused by this unless you activate the profiler
 * using one of the following methods:
 *
 *    1. Before starting the program, set the environment variable
 *       "CPUPROFILE" to be the name of the file to which the profile
 *       data should be written.
 *
 *    2. Programmatically, start and stop the profiler using the
 *       routines "ProfilerStart(filename)" and "ProfilerStop()".
 *
 *
 * (Note: if using linux 2.4 or earlier, only the main thread may be
 * profiled.)
 *
 * Use pprof to view the resulting profile output.
 *    % pprof <path_to_executable> <profile_file_name>
 *    % pprof --gv  <path_to_executable> <profile_file_name>
 *
 * These functions are thread-safe.

 *
 *   struct ProfilerOptions options;
 *   memset(&options, 0, sizeof options);
 *
 * then fill in fields as needed.
 *
 * This structure is intended to be usable from C code, so no constructor
 * is provided to initialize it.  (Use memset as described above).

['text':' Filter function and argument.
   *
   * If filter_in_thread is not NULL, when a profiling tick is delivered
   * the profiler will call:
   *
   *   (*filter_in_thread)(filter_in_thread_arg)
   *
   * If it returns nonzero, the sample will be included in the profile.
   * Note that filter_in_thread runs in a signal handler, so must be
   * async-signal-safe.
   *
   * A typical use would be to set up filter results for each thread
   * in the system before starting the profiler, then to make
   * filter_in_thread be a very simple function which retrieves those
   * results in an async-signal-safe way.  Retrieval could be done
   * using thread-specific data, or using a shared data structure that
   * supports async-signal-safe lookups.
