 * The function converts \c boost::memory_order values to the compiler-specific constants.
 *
 * NOTE: The intention is that the function is optimized away by the compiler, and the
 *       compiler-specific constants are passed to the intrinsics. Unfortunately, constexpr doesn't
 *       work in this case because the standard atomics interface require memory ordering
 *       constants to be passed as function arguments, at which point they stop being constexpr.
 *       However, it is crucial that the compiler sees constants and not runtime values,
 *       because otherwise it just ignores the ordering value and always uses seq_cst.
 *       This is the case with Intel C++ Compiler 14.0.3 (Composer XE 2013 SP1, update 3) and
 *       gcc 4.8.2. Intel Compiler issues a warning in this case:
 *
 *       warning #32013: Invalid memory order specified. Defaulting to seq_cst memory order.
 *
 *       while gcc acts silently.
 *
 *       To mitigate the problem ALL functions, including the atomic<> members must be
 *       declared with BOOST_FORCEINLINE. In this case the compilers are able to see that
 *       all functions are called with constant orderings and call intrinstcts properly.
 *
 *       Unfortunately, this still doesn't work in debug mode as the compiler doesn't
 *       propagate constants even when functions are marked with BOOST_FORCEINLINE. In this case
 *       all atomic operaions will be executed with seq_cst semantics.
