 * The basic_signal_set class provides the ability to perform an asynchronous
 * wait for one or more signals to occur.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Unsafe.
 *
 * @par Example
 * Performing an asynchronous wait:
 * @code
 * void handler(
 *     const boost::system::error_code& error,
 *     int signal_number)
 * {
 *   if (!error)
 *   {
 *     // A signal occurred.
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Construct a signal set registered for process termination.
 * boost::asio::signal_set signals(my_context, SIGINT, SIGTERM);
 *
 * // Start an asynchronous wait for one of the signals to occur.
 * signals.async_wait(handler);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Queueing of signal notifications
 *
 * If a signal is registered with a signal_set, and the signal occurs when
 * there are no waiting handlers, then the signal notification is queued. The
 * next async_wait operation on that signal_set will dequeue the notification.
 * If multiple notifications are queued, subsequent async_wait operations
 * dequeue them one at a time. Signal notifications are dequeued in order of
 * ascending signal number.
 *
 * If a signal number is removed from a signal_set (using the @c remove or @c
 * erase member functions) then any queued notifications for that signal are
 * discarded.
 *
 * @par Multiple registration of signals
 *
 * The same signal number may be registered with different signal_set objects.
 * When the signal occurs, one handler is called for each signal_set object.
 *
 * Note that multiple registration only works for signals that are registered
 * using Asio. The application must not also register a signal handler using
 * functions such as @c signal() or @c sigaction().
 *
 * @par Signal masking on POSIX platforms
 *
 * POSIX allows signals to be blocked using functions such as @c sigprocmask()
 * and @c pthread_sigmask(). For signals to be delivered, programs must ensure
 * that any signals registered using signal_set objects are unblocked in at
 * least one thread.
