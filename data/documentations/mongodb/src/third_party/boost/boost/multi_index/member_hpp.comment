['text':' member is a read/write key extractor for accessing a given
 * member of a class.
 * Additionally, member is overloaded to support referece_wrappers
 * of T and "chained pointers" to T's. By chained pointer to T we mean
 * a type P  such that, given a p of Type P
 *   *...n...*x is convertible to T&, for some n>=1.
 * Examples of chained pointers are raw and smart pointers, iterators and
 * arbitrary combinations of these (vg. T** or unique_ptr<T*>.)

['text':' MSVC++ 6.0 does not support properly pointers to members as
 * non-type template arguments, as reported in
 *   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;249045
 * A similar problem (though not identical) is shown by MSVC++ 7.0.
 * We provide an alternative to member<> accepting offsets instead
 * of pointers to members. This happens to work even for non-POD
 * types (although the standard forbids use of offsetof on these),
 * so it serves as a workaround in this compiler for all practical
 * purposes.
 * Surprisingly enough, other compilers, like Intel C++ 7.0/7.1 and
 * Visual Age 6.0, have similar bugs. This replacement of member<>
 * can be used for them too.
 *
 * Support for such old compilers is dropped and
 * [non_]const_member_offset_base is deprecated.
