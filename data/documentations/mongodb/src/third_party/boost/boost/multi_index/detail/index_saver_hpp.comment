['text':' index_saver accepts a base sequence of previously saved elements

['text':' Given a consecutive subsequence of displaced elements
     * x1,...,xn, the following information is serialized:
     *
     *   p0,p1,...,pn,0
     *
     * where pi is a pointer to xi and p0 is a pointer to the element
     * preceding x1. Crealy, from this information is possible to
     * restore the original order on loading time. If x1 is the first
     * element in the sequence, the following is serialized instead:
     *
     *   p1,p1,...,pn,0
     *
     * For each subsequence of n elements, n+2 pointers are serialized.
     * An optimization policy is applied: consider for instance the
     * sequence
     *
     *   a,B,c,D
     * 
     * where B and D are displaced, but c is in its correct position.
     * Applying the schema described above we would serialize 6 pointers:
     *
     *  p(a),p(B),0
     *  p(c),p(D),0
     * 
     * but this can be reduced to 5 pointers by treating c as a displaced
     * element:
     *
     *  p(a),p(B),p(c),p(D),0
