** BASIC DESIGN
** ------------
** 
** The implementation of lgamma is based on the following identities:
** 
** 	lgamma(x) = log(Gamma(x))					(1)
** 	Gamma(x + 1) = x*Gamma(x)					(2)
**	lgamma(1+x) = -ln(1+x) + x*(1 - g) + P(x)			(3)
** 	lgamma(x) ~ (x - .5)*ln(x) - x + .5*ln(2*pi) + x*phi(1/x)	(4)
** 	lgamma(-x) = -{ ln[x*sin(pi*x)] + lgamma(x) - ln(pi) }		(5)
** 
** where g is Euler's constant, and
** 
** 	P(x)   = sum { n = 2, ... | (-x)^n*[zeta(n) - 1]/n }
** 	phi(z) = sum { n = 1, ... | B(2n)*z^(2n)/[2n*(2n-1)] }
** 
** where zeta(n) is the Reimann zeta function and B(n) is the n-th Bernoulli
** number.
** 
** The first step in the design is to determine where the asymptotic
** approximation, (4), is applicable.  According to Hart et. al., the error in
** (4) is less than and of the same sign as the first neglected term in
** phi(1/x).  Suppose we truncate phi(1/x) to n terms.  Then the error is
** bounded by the (n+1)st term.  Now the terms in phi(1/x) decrease to a
** certain point, and then begin to increase.  So the trick is to truncate phi
** just before the last decreasing term.  With this in mind, consider the ratio
** of consecutive terms, r(n):
** 
** 	              B(2n+2)           2n*(2n-1)*x^(2n)
** 	r(n) = --------------------- * -----------------
** 	       (2n+2)*(2n+1)*x^(2n+2)       B(2n)
** 
** 	           B(2n+2)*n(2n-1)
** 	     = ----------------------				(6)
** 	       B(2n)*(n+1)*(2n+1)*x^2
** 
** Now the terms of phi will be decreasing in magnitude as long as |r(n)| < 1,
** which is equivalent to
** 
** 		      B(2n+2)    n(2n-1)
** 		x^2 > ------- * ----------		(7)
** 		       B(2n)    (n+1)(2n+1)
** 
** Taking the smallest value of x that satisfies (7) and looking at the (n+1)-st
** term of phi, we would like the magnitude of that term to be less than the
** permissible total error, which we take to be 1/2^124.  So we need to solve
** 
** 	   B(2n+2)    / B(2n+2)    n(2n-1)    \ -(n+1)   1
** 	------------*|  ------- * -----------  |     < -----	(8)
** 	(2n+2)(2n+1)  \  B(2n)    (n+1)(2n+1) /        2^124
** 
** We could at this point convert the B(2n) terms to expressions involving the
** zeta function and factorials, apply Sterlings approximation and take
** limits to simplify the problem.  However, its easier and more accurate to
** solve (8) numerically, giving n = 41 and the minimum x as 12.971.  In order
** to simplify the screening process we will take the minimum x as 16.
** 
** So the basic algorithm is to apply equation (5) when x <= -16 and equation
** (4) when x >= 16.  Otherwise we try to "reduce" the argument to the interval
** [ b, b+1 ) where b is any convenient positive value, and apply equation (3).
** The argument reduction scheme is based on equation (2).  In particular, for
** x < b - 1 and x > b the following reductions can be used:
** 
** 	t <-- 1				t <-- 1
** 	z <-- x				z <-- x
** 	while (z < b)			while (z > b + 1)
** 	    {				    {
** 	    t <-- t*z			    z <-- z - 1
** 	    z <-- z + 1			    t <-- t*z
** 	    }				    }
** 	lgamma(x) <-- -ln(t) + P(z)	lgamma(x) <-- ln(t) + P(z)
** 
** 
** CHOSING b AND EVALUATING P(z)
** -----------------------------
** 
** From an algorithmic point of view, the choice of the reduced argument range,
** [b, b+1) is arbitrary.  However, from an implementation stand point, the
** choice of b has an impact on the "shape" of polynomial or rational
** expression used to evaluate the reduced argument.  This is particularly true
** for the unpacked x-float routines, because the evaluation is done in fixed
** point.
** 
** Because lgamma is rapidly increasing function, rational approximations are
** much more efficient that polynomial approximations.  So we will confine are
** remarks to the rational case.  All of the choices of b that were examined
** produced rational coefficients that initially increased and then decreased
** in both the numerator and denominator.  The choice of b controlled the
** length of the increasing sequence and the size of the ratio between the
** first term and the largest term.  For fixed point evaluations, it is most
** desirable for all of the terms to be decreasing, however, we were unable to 
** find a value of b for which this was true.  What follows below is a
** description of the "best we could do".
**
** Before proceeding, we point out that having the coefficients decrease in
** magnitude is a sufficient condition for having the polynomial evaluation
** routines function correctly, but is it not necessary.  A necessary condition
** is that in the alternating Horner's scheme iteration:
**
**		s(k-1) = c(k-1) - x*s(k)		(9)
**
** s(k-1) not be less than zero.
** 
** We note that gamma(n) = (n-1)! for any integer n, so that
** 
** 	lgamma(1) = log(gamma(1)) = log(0!) = log(1) = 0
** 	lgamma(2) = log(gamma(2)) = log(1!) = log(1) = 0
** 
** So that lgamma(x) has a zeros at x = 1 and x = 2.  Consequently, on the
** interval [1, 2) we can approximate lgamma(x) by an expression of the form
** (x - 1)*(x - 2)*R(x), where R(x) is a rational expression.  In order to
** minimize the sequence of increasing coefficients in R(x), we reduce the
** argument to the interval [-.5, .5) via the substitution, z = x - 3/2.  Then
** the approximation takes on the form (z + .5)*(z - .5)*U(z).  Using the Remes
** algorithm to generate coefficients for U, we see that the first three
** numerator and first two denominator coefficients are increasing.  The
** initial sequence of binary exponents are:
** 
** 	coefficient	 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  ...
** 	-----------	--- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
** 	numerator	-1   1   2   2   1   0  -1  -5
** 	denominator	 1   3   3   3   3   3   2   0
** 
** Now, except when the reduced argument, z, is exactly +/- 1/2, |2*z| < 1, so
** that we can still use the ration evaluation routine for 2*z.  In effect, we
** can scale down each of the coefficients by a appropriate power of two,
** giving binary exponents that look like:
** 
** 	coefficient	 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  ...
** 	-----------	--- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
** 	numerator	-1   0   0  -1  -3  -5  -7  -12
** 	denominator	 1   2   1   0  -1  -2  -4  -7
** 
** So that except for the first two coefficients, all the other terms are
** decreasing.  This means that we need to handle the case of |z| = 1/2
** separately.  However, this is not a problem since when |z| = 1/2, we know
** that lgamma(z) = 0.  We note that (9) is also satisfied.
**
** One last note: the Remes iterations for obtaining U(z) are rather unstable.
** rather than using REMES_FIND_RATIONAL_MODE, we use REMES_STATIC, with
** numerator/denominator degree = 13/14.  This yields an approximation good
** to slightly more that 126 bits.
** 
** With the above mind, the processing for |x| < 16 looks like:
** 
** 	t <-- 1				t <-- 1
** 	w <-- x				w <-- x
** 	while (w < 1)			while (z > 2)
** 	    {				    {
** 	    t <-- t*w			    w <-- w - 1
** 	    w <-- w + 1			    t <-- t*w
** 	    }				    }
**	y <-- 2*w - 3			y <-- 2*w - 3
**      z <-- (y-1)*(y+1)		z <-- (y-1)*(y+1)
** 	lgamma(x) <-- -ln(t) + z*V(y)	lgamma(x) <-- ln(t) + z*V(y)
**
** where V(w) = U(y/2 + 3/2)/4.
** 
** 
** 	NOTE: The following limits are useful for determining the
** 	coefficients of U;
** 
** 		     lgamma(x)
** 		lim  --------- = - euler_gamma
** 		x->1  (x-1)
** 
** 		     lgamma(x)
** 		lim  --------- = euler_gamma - 1
** 		x->2   (x-2)
** 
**
** LARGE ARGUMENTS:
** ----------------
**
** For large argument, the evaluation of lgamma(x) is based on (4) and (5).
** If we substitute (4) into (5) we have
** 	lgamma(x) ~ (x - .5)*ln(x) - x + .5*ln(2*pi) + x*phi(1/x)	(4)
**
** 	lgamma(-x) = -{ ln[x*sin(pi*x)] + lgamma(x) - ln(pi) }
** 	           ~ -{ ln[x*sin(pi*x)] + (x - .5)*ln(x) - x + .5*ln(2*pi) +
**	                  x*phi(1/x) - ln(pi) }
** 	           = -{ ln(x) + ln[sin(pi*x)] + (x - .5)*ln(x) - x +
**	                 .5*ln(2*pi) + x*phi(1/x) - ln(pi) }
** 	           = - { .5*ln(2/pi) + (x + .5)*ln(x) - x + x*phi(1/x) }
**	                 - ln[sin(pi*x)]
**
** If we define c = .5*ln(2/pi) and s = -1, then the above can be written
** as:
**
**	lgamma(-x) ~ s*{ c + [x - s*.5]*ln(x) - x + x*phi(1/x)} - ln[sin(pi*x)]
**
** Similarly, for positive x, if we define c = .5*ln(2*pi) and s = 1, then (4)
** can be written as:
**
** 	lgamma(x) ~ s*{c + (x - s*.5)*ln(x) - x + x*phi(1/x)}
**
** So that negative and positive cases can share a significant portion of code.
