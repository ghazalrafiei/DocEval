 * GENERAL COMMENTS:
 * -----------------
 *
 * The error function, erf(x) is defined for all values of x by the integral:
 *
 *	                  /\ x
 *	            2     |
 *	erf(x) = -------- | exp(-t^2)dt
 *		 sqrt(pi) |
 *		         \/ 0
 *
 * From the definition and the taylor expansion for exp(x) is follows that
 *
 *		erf(-x) = - erf(x)			(1)
 *
 *	                   ____
 *	            2      \    (-x)^(2k+1)
 *	erf(x) = --------  /    -----------		(2)
 *		 sqrt(pi) /____  k! (2k+1)
 *	                  k = 0
 *
 * The complementary error function, erfc(x) is defined as 1 - erf(x).  erfc(x)
 * can be approximated asymtotically by:
 *
 *	                     /       ____                \
 *	           exp(-x^2) |       \    (-1)^k (2k)!   |
 *	erfc(x) ~ ---------- | 1 +   /    -------------- |	(3)
 *		  x*sqrt(pi) |      /____  4^k k! x^(2k) |
 *	                     \      k = 1                /
 *
 * and computed directly as a continued fraction:
 *
 *	                     /                        \
 *	           exp(-x^2) |  1   1/2  2/2  3/2  4/2 |
 *	erfc(x) = ---------- | ---  ---  ---  ---  --- |	(4)
 *		   sqrt(pi)  | x +  x +  x +  x +  x + |
 *	                     \                        /
 *
 * For large values of x, computing erf(x) via (2) is time consuming and
 * incurs significant roundoff error.  Consequently, for large x, it is
 * best to compute erf(x) as 1 - erfc(x), where erfc(x) is computed via (3).
 * Similarly computing erfc(x) for small values of x is time consuming and
 * inaccurate, so it is best to compute erfc(x) = 1 - erf(x) for small x.
 * Since erf(x) and erfc(x) are bounded between 0 and 1 for positive x, there
 * is no loss of significance in computing 1 - erf(x) or 1 - erfc(x) if
 * erf(x) and erfc(x) are less than or equal to 1/2.  Let s be a point such
 * that erf(s) = 1/2.  It follows from the definition of erfc that erfc(x) =
 * 1/2.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
 * ----------------------
 *
 * When x is small, erf(x) = 2*x/sqrt(pi) to machine precision.  In particular
 * if x satifies
 *
 *		2*x/sqrt(pi) - erf(x)
 *		---------------------- < 2^-(F_PRECISION + 1)
 *		       erf(x)
 *
 * then erf(x) = 2*x/sqrt(pi) to machine precision.  For k >= 1, let rho(k) =
 * 1 + 2^-(F_PRECISION + k), if r satifies
 *
 *			erf(r)/r = 2/(rho(k)*sqrt(pi))
 *
 * then it follows that for |x| < r, erf(x) = 2*x/sqrt(pi) to machine precision.
 * The reason for not fixing k = 1 in the above equation, is because we need
 * to consider the manner in which x*(2/sqrt(pi)) is computed.  Since
 * 2/sqrt(pi) is not exact, but close to 1, we can improve the accuracy of the
 * final approximation by computing erf(x) for small x as:
 *
 *		erf(x) = x + (2/sqrt(pi) - 1)*x
 *
 * The final error will the error in the above computation, plus the error
 * induced by truncating the series.  For k = 1, the induced error is 1/2 bit.
 * In order to keep the final error below 1 lsb, it is better to increase
 * k to 2.  This will limit the induced error to 1/4 lsb.
 *
 * Also note that for very small x, (2/sqrt(pi) - 1)*x will underflow, even
 * though the final result doesn't.  To avoid this problem, we note that
 * (2/sqrt(pi) - 1) > (1/8) and compute erf(x) for small x as:
 *
 *		erf(x) = (8*x + 8*(2/sqrt(pi) - 1)*x)*(1/8)
 *
 * Similarly, when x is small, erfc(x) = 1 to machine precision.  Specifically
 * if r' satisfies
 *
 *			erfc(r') = 1/rho(1),
 *
 * then for |x| < r', erf(x) = 1 to machine precision.

 * DENORM PROCESSING:

 * ERF(x) and ERFC(x) EVALUATION FOR SMALL ARGUMENTS:
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Using (2) to approximate erf(x) is fairly straight forward.  We assume that
 * the (2) can be written as x*R(x^2), where R is a rational function.  We note
 * that R(0) = 2/sqrt(pi) ~ 1.12837916.  So we can reformulate the computation
 * and improve the accuracy by evaluating (2) in the form x + x*S(x^2).  Since
 * 2/sqrt(pi) ~ 1.12837916, when x is small, the overhang between x and x*S(x)
 * is 3 bits unless x is close to a power of two, in which case it is 2 bits.
 * As x increases to about .617 the overhang increases to about 13 bits.  As x
 * continues to increase, the overhang decreases until it reaches a 3 bit
 * overhang at .942.  The reason for the dramatic increase in overhang near
 * .617 is that the function x*S(x^2) has zero in that region.  This means
 * that x*S(x^2) has a massive loss of significance near .617.  Fortunately,
 * for x < .617, the alignment shift between x and x*S(x^2) is sufficient to
 * compensate for the loss of significance.  For x > .617, the alignment
 * shift is not as effective at compensatating.
 *
 * We can use (2) to compute erfc(x) when x is small as:
 *
 *		erfc(x) = 1 - x*R(x^2)
 *		        = 1 - {x + x*[R(x^2) - 1]}
 *		        = (1 - x) + x*[R(x^2) - 1]
 *
 * Graphing the overhang between (1-x) and x*[R(x^2) - 1], we note the the
 * overhang decreases with x to a 4 bit overhang near .5, then increases to
 * 12 bits near .617 and then steadily decreases as x gets larger.  At x = .75
 * the overhang is 3 bits and for x > .75 the overhang is less than 3 bits.
 * Problems with loss of significance near .617 are similar to the erf case.
 *
 * The upshot of the above, is that if approximate erf(x) - x on the interval
 * [0, .617] then we can compute both erf(x) and erfc(x) using that
 * approximation and obtain (almost always) a 3 bit overhang on the last
 * add.  This should result in an error bound < 1 ulp on that interval for 
 * both functions.
 *
 * Note that when computing 1 - x in the erfc case, the subtraction is not
 * exact so some care needs to be taken.  Specifically, let z = 1 - x and 
 * y = x + (z - 1), then we can compute erfc as:
 *
 *		erfc(x) = (1 - x) + x*[R(x^2) - 1]
 *		        = (z - y) + x*[R(x^2) - 1]
 *		        = z + { x*[R(x^2) - 1] - y }
 *
 * At first glance, approximating the function on the interval [0, .617] may
 * seem quite wasteful, since the interval is relatively large and consequently
 * the evaluation will be slow.  However, the terms in the series decrease
 * as 1/n! so the convergence is fast.  Also, the alternative is to use an
 * approximation based on equations (3) or (4), both of which require an
 * evaluation of exp(-x^2).

 * For large x, using the asymtotic approximation (3) is the most efficient

 * COMPUTING EXP(-x^2)
 * -------------------
 *
 * Expansion (3) involves the compution of exp(-x^2).  Since small variations
 * in the argument to exp results in large errors in the result, it is
 * necessary to compute -x^2 to extra precision.  The basic approach is to
 * compute x^2 in hi and lo pieces and note that exp(-hi) can be computed
 * in extra precision (using the special exp entry point) as exp(-hi) =
 * 2^I*(fhi + flo).   Exp(-lo) can be computed as a polynomial of the form
 * 1 - lo*Q(lo).  Combining the above, we have:
 *
 *	exp(-x^2) = exp(-(hi + lo))
 *	          = exp(-hi) * exp(-lo)
 *	          = 2^I*(fhi + flo) * [1 - lo*Q(lo)]
 *	          = 2^I*{ fhi + flo - (fhi + flo)*lo*Q(lo) }
 *	          = 2^I*{ fhi + [flo - f*lo*Q(lo)]}
 *	          = 2^I*{ fhi + V }
 *
 * Noting the computation of exp(-x^2), using expansion (3) to compute erfc(x) 
 * results in a computation of the form:
 *
 *	erfc(x) = exp(-x^2)*z*[.5 + P(z^2)]			(5)
 *	        = 2^I*[ fhi + V ]*z*[.5 + P(z^2)]
 *	        = 2^(I - 1)*z*[ fhi + V ]*z*[1 + 2*P(z^2)]
 *	        = 2^(I - 1)*z*[ fhi + V + (fhi + V)*2*P(z^2)]
 *	        = 2^(I - 1)*z*[ fhi + U(x)]
 *
 * Based on the above, we have the following approach to computing erfc(x)
 *
 *	(1) get x^2 as hi and lo pieces
 *	(2) call special exp entry to get I(x), fhi and flo
 *	(3) V <-- flo - (fhi + flo)*lo*Q(lo)
 *	(4) z <-- 1/x
 *	(4) U <-- V + (fhi + V)*2*P(z^2)
 *	(5) result <-- 2^(I - 1)*z*(fhi + V)
