** BASIC DESIGN
** ------------
** 
** The erf/erfc design is based on the following identities:
** 
** 	           2*x     __inf (-x^2)^k
** 	erf(x) = --------  >     --------			(1)
** 	         sqrt(pi) /__0   (k+1)*k!
** 
** 	erfc(x) = 1 - erf(x)					(2)
** 
** 	           exp(-x^2)   __inf     (2k)!
** 	erfc(x) ~  ----------  >     -------------		(3)
** 	           x*sqrt(pi) /__0   k!*(-4*x^2)^k
** 
** 	          exp(-x^2) /  1  1/2 2/2 3/2    \
** 	erfc(x) = --------- | --- --- --- --- ... |		(4)
**	          sqrt(pi)  \ x + x + x + x +    /
** 
** 
** The domain of the two functions is divided into 8 subintervals, symmetrically
** placed around 0.  For each subinterval, the general approach is to perform 
** some primary evaluation and then adjust its sign and add or subtract a
** constant.
** 
** On the first subinterval, from 0 to 1, the primary evaluation is a rational
** approximation to erf(x) of the form x*R(x^2), based on (1).  It should be
** noted here that the upper bound of this interval could be taken as large as
** 2 and still have the terms of R(x^2) be decreasing. However, as the upper
** limit increases past 1, loss of significance when computing 1 - erf(x)
** becomes a problem, so we take the upper limit of the first interval a 1
** because it simplifies the interval determination logic. 
** 
** The second subinterval spans 1 to A, where A is chosen so that if x >= A, the
** correctly rounded value of erf(x) is 1.  On this subinterval, the primary
** evaluation is an approximation to erfc(x), of the form exp(-x*x)*S(x), where
** S(x) is a rational approximation based on (4).
** 
** The third subinterval spans A to B, where B is chosen so that if x >= B, then
** erfc(x) underflows.  On this subinterval, the primary evaluation is an
** approximation to erfc(x) of the form exp(-x*x)*T(1/x^2)/x, where T(1/x^2)
** is a rational approximation based on (3).
** 
** The actual values of A and B are somewhat arbitrary.  For this design we take
** B = 128, since that choice helps simplify the determination of the intervals.
** A is chosen to be 8.75.  The reason for this choice of A is that:
** 
** 	o it meets the requirement that x >= A ==> erf(x) = 1,
** 	o A has very few significant bits, so its fraction can be represented
** 	  in one word
** 	o For this choice of A or larger, the terms in T(1/x^2) decrease

** 
** IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
** -----------------------
** 
** Based on the above definitions and equation (2) we can construct table 1
** which shows how erf(x) and erfc(x) are computed based on which interval
** they lie in.  In the table we refer to the primary evaluations in the first,
** second and third subintervals as ERF(x), MID(x) and ERFC(x) respectively.
** 
** 
** 	Sub-Interval	Index	  erf(x)	  erfc(x)
** 	------------	-----	-----------	------------
**	(-Inf,  -128]     7	-1              2
**	(-128, -8.75]     6	-1              2
**	[-8.75,   -1)     5	-1 + MID(|x|)   2 - MID(|x|)
**	(-1,       0)     4	 0 - ERF(|x|)   1 + ERF(|x|)
**	( 0,       1)     0	 0 + ERF(|x|)   1 - ERF(|x|)
**	[ 1,    8.75]     1	 1 - MID(|x|)	0 + MID(x)
** 	( 8.75,  128]     2	 1         	0 + ERFC(|x|)
** 	( 128,  +Inf]     3	 1         	underflow
** 
** 			    Table 1
** 			    -------
** 
** Ignoring for the time being, that underflows may need to be signaled, the
** evaluation scheme for each subinterval, for both functions, is of the form:
** 
** 			   c + t*F(x) 			(5)
** where
** 
** 		o t is +/-1
** 		o c is -1, 0, 1 or 2
** 		o F(x) is ERF(x), MID(x), ERFC(x), UNDERFLOW(x) or 0
** 
** Based on the above, we implement erf and erfc as calls into a common
** evaluation routine, C_UX_ERF, that determines the interval the argument
** lies in and then dispatches to the appropriate evaluation code.
** 
** 
** MAPPING INTERVALS TO EVALUATIONS
** --------------------------------
** 
** The mapping from interval to evaluation function can be done via a switch
** statement on the interval.  The cases for ERFC(x) and UNDERFLOW need to check
** for whether an erf(x) or erfc(x) evaluation is being performed.
** 
** The selection of the constants, c can be accomplished by encoding the 
** appropriate values of c for erfc(x) in a "bit string" that can be indexed
** by the interval number.  Actually, rather then encoding the constants
** themselves we encode the index into an unpacked constant table.  Letting
** the index for c = -1, 0, 1 and 2 be c + 1 (i.e the indices 0, 1, 2 and
** 3 correspond to the constants -1, 0, 1 and 2), we can create two integers,
** defined by:
** 
** 		 1   1   1
** 		 4   2   0   8   6   4   2   0: bit position
** 	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
** 	erfc: | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
** 	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
** 	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
** 	erf:  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
** 	      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
** 
** that map indices of the constants to the intervals. Note that given one of
** the above integers, we can determine if an erf or erfc evaluation is being
** performed by looking at the low bit.

** CALCULATING MID(x)
** -------------------
**
** The rational expression that needs to be evaluated for mid(x) is particularly
** ill behaved from the point of view of the general unpacked rational
** evaluation routine.  So ill behaved in fact, that the general routine can
** not be used for the evaluation.  The problem is that over the range
** [1, 8.75), the evaluation cannot be formulated in such a way that the
** terms decrease in magnitude and at the same time have the argument be less
** that 1 is absolute value.  Since this is the evaluation in the math library
** that has these characteristics, the special evaluation code for this case
** is included here.
**
** The solution to the problem is to use a special (less efficient) packed format for
** the evaluation.  See dpml_ux_ops.c for at description of the format.
