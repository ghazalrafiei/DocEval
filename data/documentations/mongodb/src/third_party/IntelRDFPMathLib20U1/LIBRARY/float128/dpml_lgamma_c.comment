     * Lgamma(x) is defined as the log(|gamma(x)|), where gamma(x) is defined
     * for positive x as
     *
     *      gamma(x) = integral{ 0 to infinity | t^(x-1)e^t dt }
     *
     * From the definition of gamma(x) it follows that
     *
     *              x*gamma(x) = gamma(x+1)             (1)
     *
     * and the limit as x --> +0 of gamma(x) = +infinity.  Equation (1) can be
     * used to extend gamma(x) to negitive numbers by recursively applying:
     *
     *      gamma(-x) = gamma(1 - x)/(-x)               (2)
     *
     * Since gamma(0) = + infinity, it follows that gamma(n) is undefined for
     * any non-positive integer.  An alternative extension of gamma to negative
     * arguments is the reflection fomula
     *
     *      gamma(-x) = -pi/(sin(pi*x)*gamma(1 + x))     (3)
     *
     * Evalutation of lgamma(x) suffers potential loss of significance at
     * its zeros or alternatively, when |gamma(x)| = 1.  From the definition
     * of gamma and (1) we see that |gamma(x)| = 1 for positive x only at
     * x = 1 and 2.  From equation (2), we see that |gamma(x)| = 1 when x
     * is a negative integer  +/- epsilon, where epsilon is on the order
     * of 1/n!.
     *
     * Computation of lgamma(x) is based on two identities:
     *
     *                                    zeta(2)-1      zeta(3)-1

     * When x is not large, the computation of lgamma is based on equations
     * (1) and (2).  Specifically, let
     *
     *          lgamma(n+x) = log(F(n,x)) + x*Q(x)
     *
     * where Q(x) is defined by equation (4).  From equation (1) it follows
     * that
     *
     *          lgamma(n+1+x) = log((n+x)*gamma(n+x)
     *                        = log(n+x) + lgamma(n+x)
     *                        = log(n+x) + log(F(n,x)) + x*Q(x)
     *                        = log[(n+x)*F(n,x)] + x*Q(x)
     *
     * From the above and equation (4) it follows that F(1,x) = 1+x and 
     * F(n+1, x) = (n+x)*F(n,x).  Note the F(n,x) is define for both
     * negative and positive integers.
     *
     * Since we know the range of our x value for this evaluation we can
     * increase the accuracy of the computation of x*Q(x) by performing
     * the following transformation:
     *
     *      Given Q(x) = p(x)/q(x), define R(X) as 
     *  
     *          Q(x) = 1/2 - R(x)
     *
     *      This yields
     *
     *          R(x) = p(x) - q(x)/2
     *                 -------------
     *                    q(x)
     *
     * Now x*Q(x) can be computed as x*(1/2 - R(x)), or rather x*(1/2) - x*R(x)
     * which forces, x*(1/2), the most significant term, to be exact.
     *
     *
     *    NOTE: We need coefficients for Q and phi.  From (4) we obtain
     *    Q by approximating 
     *
     *           (lgamma(1+x) + ln(1 + x))/x
     *
     *    on the interval [-.5, .5].  A rational approximation for Q
     *    has competative performance on ALPHA with a polynomial
     *    approximation.
     *
     *    From (5) we obtain phi by approximating
     *
     *           x * [lgamma(x) - .5*ln(2*pi) + x - (x - .5)*ln(x)]
     *
     *    on the range [8,max_val], where max_val is the largest
     *    value of x which will be evaluated by phi (i.e. for X>x, phi(x)
     *    is insignificant to the other terms of the sum in (5).
