** OVERVIEW
** --------
**
** The implementation of the trig functions is based on four support routines:
** two common evaluation routine (one for sin/cos/sind/cosd and one for
** tan/cot/tand/cotd) together with two argument reduction routines, one for
** radian arguments and one for degree arguments.
** 
** There are various reduction schemes that can be used for trigonometric
** functions.  The polynomial evaluation routines require that the terms in
** the series decrease in magnitude.  For the trig functions, this implies
** that an argument reduction scheme should return a reduce argument with
** magnitude less than or equal to pi/4 is an appropriate choice.  In
** particular, we assume that for a given value, x, the argument reduction
** scheme (for both radian and degrees) produces two integers, I1 and I and an
** unpacked floating point result, z, such that
** 
** 	x = (2*pi)*I1 + I*(pi/2) + z, 	|z| <= pi/4
** 
**		NOTE: having the degree reduction return the reduced
**		argument in radian permits the use of only one set
**		of polynomial coefficient and simplifies the evaluation
**		logic.
**
** The value of I we will refer to as the quadrant bits and z as the reduced
** argument.  We assume also that argument reduction routines returns both I
** and z to its caller.  (I1 is never needed in the subsequent computations,
** so it is not returned.)
** 
** The following table gives an estimate of the number of terms in a polynomial
** and rational approximation for each of the basic trig functions.  For
** rational approximations the degree of the numerator and denominator are
** presented as an ordered pair.  The approximation is assumed to be good to
** 128 bits for |x| <= pi/4.  The values in this table were extrapolated from
** the tables given in Hart et. al.
** 
** 			   approximation form
** 			------------------------
** 	function	polynomial	rational
** 	--------	----------	--------
** 	sin		    12		 (6, 6)
** 	cos		    12		 (6, 6)
** 	tan		    29		 (7, 7)
** 
** So from the above table, it seems most efficient to evaluate sin and cos via
** polynomials and evaluate tangent via a rational approximation.  So we assume
** that for |x| <= pi/4, we have polynomials, S, C, P and Q such that
** 
** 		sin(x) ~ x*S(x^2)
** 		cos(x) ~ C(x^2)
** 		tan(x) ~ x*P(x^2)/Q(x^2)
** 		cot(x) ~ Q(x^2)/*[x*P(x^2)]
** 
** Now, for any argument, x, given its reduced argument, z, and its quadrant
** bits, I, we can evaluate sin, cos, tan and cot of x according to Table 1.
** ( For brevity we denote z*P(z^2) by p, Q(z^2) by q, etc):

**
** REDUCTION INTERFACE:
** --------------------
** 
** As mentioned earlier, the overall design of the the trig routines is
** dependent on two routines to do argument reduction.  The prototype for 
** these functions is;
** 
** 		WORD
** 		__reduce(
** 		    _UX_FLOAT * unpacked_argument,
** 		    INT_64      octant,
** 		    _UX_FLOAT * reduced_argument
** 		    )
** 
** Assuming that 'unpacked_argument' points to a _UX_FLOAT data item with value
** x, then the semantics of the reduction routines are to compute integers I1
** and I, and a floating point value, z, such that
** 
** 	x + octant*(CYCLE/4) = (2*CYCLE)*I1 + (CYCLE/2) + z,  |z| < CYCLE/4
** 
** Note that performing the reduction on x + octant*(CYCLE/4), rather than x,
** not only allows us to deal with the <name>_vo entry points easily, it also
** permits easy use of the identities cos(x) = sin(x + CYCLE/2) and cot(x) = 
** tan(CYCLE/2) to consolidate the overall processing.
** 
** 
** 
** EVALUATION INTERFACE:
** ---------------------
** 
** The prototypes for each of the two evaluation routines is;
** 
** 	void
** 	__trig_evaluate(
** 	    UX_FLOAT * unpacked_argument,
** 	    WORD       octant,
** 	    U_WORD     function_code,
** 	    UX_FLOAT * unpacked_result
** 	    );
** 
** The evaluation routines need not know whether the evaluation is for degrees
** because the appropriate reduction is done based on the value of
** function_code.

** UX_DEGREE_REDUCE performs argument reduction for degree arguments.  The
** reduction is performed in three phases:
**
**	(1) if |x| >= 2^141, reduce modulo 360 to a value less than 2^141
**	    by operating on the exponent field of x
**	(2) if |x| > 2^15, reduce modulo 360 to a value less that 2^15
**	    by operating on the integer portion of x
**	(3) if |x| < 2^15, compute I = nint(x/90) and the reduced argument
**	    as x - I*90
**
** The details of each of these phases is discussed in more detail in the
** code.

        ** This is a very large argument.  We make use of the identity
        **
        **	8*(2^12)^(n+1) = 8*(136)^(n+1)	(mod 360)
        **	               = [8*(136)]*(136)^n
        **	               = (1088)*(136)^n
        **	               = 8*(136)^n	(mod 360)
        **
        ** Or employing induction, 8*(2^12)^n = 8 (mod 360)
        **
        ** If p is the precision of the data type, we begin by writing the
        ** input argument x as:
        **
        **	x = 2^n*f
        **	  = 2^(n-p)*(2^p*f)
        **	  = 2^(n-p)*F
        **
        ** where F = 2^p*f is an integer.  Now let k = floor((n - p - 3)/12)
        ** and r = n - p - 3 - 12*k.  Then
        **
        **	x = 2^(n-p)*F
        **	  = 2^(12k + r + 3)*F
        **	  = 8*2^(12k)]*(2^r*F)
        **	  = [8*(2^12)^k]*(2^r*F)
        **	  = 8*(2^r*F)			(mod 360)
        **	  = 2^(3 + r + p)*f
        **	  = 2^(n - 12*k)*f
        **
        ** So the approach is to find k and subtract 12*k from the exponent
        ** field.  This will reduce the input argument to a number less than
        ** 2^(p + 14)
        **
        ** One last note.  We don't actually do an integer divide to get
        ** k.  Rather we multiply n by an integer that is effectively the 
        ** reciprocal of 12.  This is easier to do if the exponent field
        ** is positive so we want to add a bias to the exponent that is
        ** divisible by 12 and that will force the exponent to be positive.
        ** We assume at this point that |exponent| < (1 << F_EXP_WIDTH).
        **
        ** Let the bias = 12*B, then
        **
        **		k = floor((n - p - 3)/12)
        **		  = floor((n - p - 3 + 12*B - 12*B)/12)
        **		  = floor((n - p - 3 + 12*B)/12 - B)
        **		  = floor((n - p - 3 + 12*B)/12) - B
        **		  = floor((n + (12*B - p - 3))/12) - B
        ** 
        ** 	==> n - 12*k = n - 12*[floor((n + (12*B - p - 3))/12) - B]
        ** 	             = n - 12*floor((n + (12*B - p - 3))/12) - 12*B
