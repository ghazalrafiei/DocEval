** The DPML supports two different varieties of the power function: one for
** which 0^0 and (-x)^integer are exceptions (fortran semantics) and one for
** which 0^0 is 1 and (-x)^integer is computed as if by successive
** multiplications (C semantics).  Both of these routines call a common
** interface routine which unpacks the unpacks the argument and performs any
** necessary argument screening.  The common interface routine then calls an
** evaluation routine to actually compute the function result.
** 
** 
** BASIC ALGORITHM
** ---------------
** 
** The power function x^y is computed as 2^[y*log2(x)].  The key point in the
** algorithm is to insure a sufficient number of accurate bits in the product
** y*log2(x) to guarantee the accuracy of the final result.  In particular,
** if we write:
** 
** 		y*log2(x) = I + h	|h| < 1/2		(1)
** 
** Then
** 
** 		x^y = 2^[y*log2(x)]
** 		    = 2^(I + h)
** 		    = (2^I)*(2^h)
** 
** Since the multiplication by 2^I can be done by incrementing the exponent
** field of 2^h, the basic design criteria is to insure a sufficient number
** of bits in h.  For this design, we would like h to have 7 guard bits.  That
** means we want the total number of good bits in h to be about 120.  Since I
** can contain as many as 14 bits, this means that y*log(x) must contain at
** least 134 good bits.  This of course is a problem, because the unpacked
** format only has 128 fraction bits.  The approach we take is to represent
** log2(x) in high and low pieces.

    ** COMPUTING LOG IN HI AND LOW PIECES
    ** -----------------------------------
    ** 
    ** Given x = 2^n*g, where 1/sqrt(2) <= g < sqrt(2), we can compute log2(x)
    ** as:
    ** 		     2(g - 1)		     2
    ** 		z = ----------		w = z
    ** 		    (g + 1)ln2
    ** 		                                      2k
    ** 		                    __Inf [z*ln2/2)^2]
    ** 		log2(x) = n +   z   >     -------------
    ** 		                   /__k=0    (2k+1)
    ** 
    ** 		                    
    ** 		log2(x) ~ n +  z + z^3*p(z^2) 
    ** 
    ** 
    ** Letting z = z_hi + z_lo, then we can write
    ** 
    ** 		log2(x) ~ n + (z_hi + z_lo) + z*w*p(w) 
    ** 		        = (n + z_hi) + (z_lo + z*w*p(w))
    ** 		        = L_hi + L_lo.				(3)
    ** 
    ** The trick here is to define z_hi, so that n + z_hi is exactly
    ** representable in one digit.  This involves computing z to extended
    ** precision which is a fairly complicated process.  We begin by
