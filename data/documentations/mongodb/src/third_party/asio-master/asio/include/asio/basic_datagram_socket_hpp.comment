   * This function is used to asynchronously receive a datagram. The function
   * call always returns immediately.
   *
   * @param buffers One or more buffers into which the data will be received.
   * Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the
   * underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee
   * that they remain valid until the handler is called.
   *
   * @param sender_endpoint An endpoint object that receives the endpoint of
   * the remote sender of the datagram. Ownership of the sender_endpoint object
   * is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that it is valid until the
   * handler is called.
   *
   * @param handler The handler to be called when the receive operation
   * completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function
   * signature of the handler must be:
   * @code void handler(
   *   const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
   *   std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes received.
   * ); @endcode
   * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
   * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation
   * of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using
   * asio::io_context::post().
   *
   * @par Example
   * To receive into a single data buffer use the @ref buffer function as
   * follows:
   * @code socket.async_receive_from(
   *     asio::buffer(data, size), sender_endpoint, handler); @endcode
