     * Our random number generator has two parts that operate independently. We need to seed both
     * with a non-zero value to get the maximum variation. We may be called with a seed that is less
     * than 2^32, so we need to work with zeroes in one half of our 64 bit seed.

         * We'd like to seed our random generator with a 3 byte value. This gives us plenty of
         * variation for testing, but yet makes the seed more convenient for human use. We generate
         * an initial "random" seed that we can then manipulate.
         *
         * However, the initial "random" seed is not random with respect to time, because it is
         * based on the system clock. Successive calls to this function may yield the same clock
         * time on some systems, and that leaves us with the same random seed. So we factor in a "n"
         * value from the caller to get up to 4 different random seeds.
