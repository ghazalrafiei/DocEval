 * The motivation for this test is to try and reproduce BF-24385 by stressing insert functionality.
 * The test creates a lot of threads that concurrently insert a lot of records with random keys.
 * Having a large memory page ensures that we have big insert lists. Big cache size allows having
 * more dirty content in the memory before eviction kicks in. The test is in C suite because CPP
 * suite does not allow overriding validation at the moment.
