 * JIRA ticket reference: WT-2447
 *
 * Test case description: This test case is adapted from the submitted test
 * program in the JIRA ticket. We create a database of 10,000 entries, with
 * every key i having pair of values (i, i).  Create indices on both values,
 * and establish a join: table.v1 >= 5000 AND table.v2 < 5001.  There's a
 * Bloom filter on v2.  We expect that although we iterate from 5000 to
 * 10000, we'll only have accesses to the main table for key 5000, as
 * 5001-10000 will generally not be in the Bloom filter.  For key 5000,
 * we technically have two accesses to the main table - one occurs when we
 * see key 5000 is in the Bloom filter, and we need to do a full test, we
 * make an access to the projection table:tablename(v2), that's just to get
 * the value of v2, which we'll check by comparison to the cursor at 5001.
 * That counts as a main table access, and when we see it is satisfied and
 * return the complete set of values, we'll access the main table with the
 * full projection (that's the second main table access).
 *
 * Failure mode: Before fixes of WT-2447, we saw lots of accesses to the main
 * table.
