 * JIRA ticket reference: WT-2592 Test case description: This is an adaptation of the join parts of
 * ex_schema.c, but written as a test. Though we have join tests in the Python test suite, the
 * Python API uses raw mode for cursors, so errors that are specific to non-raw mode are undetected
 * in Python. Failure mode: The failure seen in WT-2592 was that no items were returned by a join.
