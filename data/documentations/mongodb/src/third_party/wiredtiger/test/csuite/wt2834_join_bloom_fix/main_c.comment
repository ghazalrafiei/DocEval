 * JIRA ticket reference: WT-2834
 * Test case description: We are creating bank 'account' records, each
 * having a postal_code, balance, and an 'overdrawn' flag.  We insert
 * records with various balances, and only set the overdrawn flag when the
 * balance is negative.  Then we set up a join to simulate this:
 *
 *   select (*) from account where account.postal_code = '54321' and
 *                      account.balance < 0 and not account.overdrawn
 *
 * Failure mode: We get results back from our join.
