 * JIRA ticket reference: WT-3874 Test case description: Set up a collator that only uses the first
 * byte of a record for comparison; all other bytes are considered padding. With that collator for a
 * table, insert an item, then remove that item (with different padding). Failure mode: An assertion
 * is fired when we get back the key as stored in the record, if we compare it to the given key
 * without taking into account the collator.
