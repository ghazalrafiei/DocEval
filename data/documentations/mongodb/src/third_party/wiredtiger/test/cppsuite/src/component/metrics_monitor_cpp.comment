 * The WiredTiger configuration API doesn't accept string statistic names when retrieving statistic
 * values. This function provides the required mapping to statistic id. We should consider
 * generating it programmatically in `stat.py` to avoid having to manually add a condition every
 * time we want to observe a new postrun statistic.
