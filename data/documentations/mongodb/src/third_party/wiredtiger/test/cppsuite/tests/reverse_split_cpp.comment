 * This test inserts data at the end of the collection and truncates off from the start of the
 * collection. In doing so pages at the start of the tree are gradually emptied while pages are
 * added at the end of the tree. This means the test frequently executes the reverse split path.

         * configuration and then adding ours on the end.

             * which means in theory more eviction, or reverse splits happen at the same time.
