 * This class represents an active connection to the AWS S3 endpoint and allows for interaction with
 * S3-Crt client. The S3Connection exposes an API to list the bucket contents filtered by a
 * directory and a prefix, check for an object's existence in the bucket, put an object to the
 * cloud, and get the object from the cloud. Though not required for the file system's
 * implementation, the class also provides the means to delete the objects to clean up artifacts
 * from the internal unit testing. Note we are using S3-Crt client in this class, which differs to
 * the S3 client.
