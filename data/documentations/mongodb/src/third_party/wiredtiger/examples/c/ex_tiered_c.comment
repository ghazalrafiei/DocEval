 * A storage source is a driver that controls access to an underlying object storage (e.g. a

     * Set up configuration for tiered storage. When tiered storage is configured, all tables
     * created will be tiered by default (that is, parts will be stored in object storage), though
     * tiered storage can be turned off on an individual basis.
     *
     * When configuring tiered storage with a cloud provider, one usually needs an access key. A
     * reference to this, an "authorization token", is usually provided in the configuration string.
     * This simple example uses "dir_store", a local directory based stand-in for a cloud provider,
     * and no explicit access keys are needed.
     *
     * For learning purposes, one can single step this program and watch files created in the
     * "bucket" subdirectory during the tiered checkpoint.
