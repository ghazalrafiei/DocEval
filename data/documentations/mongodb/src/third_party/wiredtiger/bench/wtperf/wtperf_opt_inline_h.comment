 * Each option listed here represents a CONFIG struct field that may be
 * altered on command line via -o and -O.  Each option appears here as:
 *    DEF_OPT_AS_BOOL(name, initval, desc)
 *    DEF_OPT_AS_CONFIG_STRING(name, initval, desc)
 *    DEF_OPT_AS_STRING(name, initval, desc)
 *    DEF_OPT_AS_UINT32(name, initval, desc)
 *
 * The first four forms (*_{CONFIG_STRING|STRING|BOOL|UINT}) have these
 * parameters:
 *    name:     a C identifier, this identifier will be a field in CONFIG,
 *              and identifies the option for -o or -O.
 *    initval:  a default initial value for the field.
 *              The default values are tiny, we want the basic run to be fast.
 *    desc:     a description that will appear in the usage message.
 *
 * The difference between CONFIG_STRING and STRING is that CONFIG_STRING
 * options are appended to existing content, whereas STRING options overwrite.
