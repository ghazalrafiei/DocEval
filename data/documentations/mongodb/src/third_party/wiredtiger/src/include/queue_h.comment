 * This is a stripped-down version of the FreeBSD sys/queue.h include file.
 *
 * WiredTiger only uses the TAILQ macros (we've gotten into trouble in the past
 * by trying to use simpler queues and subsequently discovering a list we didn't
 * think would ever get to be large could, under some workloads, become large,
 * and the linear performance for removal of elements from simpler macros proved
 * to be more trouble than the memory savings were worth.
 *
 * We #undef all of the macros because there are incompatible versions of this
 * file and these macros on various systems.  What makes the problem worse is
 * they are included and/or defined by system include files which we may have
 * already loaded into Berkeley DB before getting here.  For example, FreeBSD's
 * <rpc/rpc.h> includes its system <sys/queue.h>, and VxWorks UnixLib.h defines
 * several of the LIST_XXX macros.  Visual C.NET 7.0 also defines some of these
 * same macros in Vc7\PlatformSDK\Include\WinNT.h.  Make sure we use ours.
