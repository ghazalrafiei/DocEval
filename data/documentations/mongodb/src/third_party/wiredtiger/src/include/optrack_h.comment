 * WT_OPTRACK_RECORD --
 *     A structure for logging function entry and exit events.
 *
 * We pad the record so that the size of the entire record is 16 bytes. If we
 * don't do this, the compiler will pad it for us, because we keep records in
 * the record buffer array and each new record must be aligned on the 8-byte
 * boundary, since its first element is an 8-byte timestamp. Instead of letting
 * the compiler insert the padding silently, we pad explicitly, so that whoever
 * writes the binary decoder can refer to this struct to find out the record
 * size.
 *
 * The operation id included in this structure is a unique address of a function
 * in the binary. As we log operations, we keep track of the correspondence
 * between function addresses and their names. When the log file is decoded,
 * operations identifiers are replaced with function names. Therefore, the
 * present design assumes that the user will be inserting the tracking macros
 * on function boundaries: when we enter into the function and when we exit
 * from it.

 * We do not synchronize access to optrack buffer pointer under the assumption that there is no more
 * than one thread using a given session. This assumption does not always hold. When it does not, we
 * might have a race. In this case, we may lose a few log records. We prefer to risk losing a few
 * log records occasionally in order not to synchronize this code, which is intended to be very
 * lightweight. Exclude the default session (ID 0) because it can be used by multiple threads and it
 * is also used in error paths during failed open calls.
