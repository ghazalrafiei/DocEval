         * Eviction can fail when a page in the evicted page's subtree switches state. For example,
         * if we don't evict a page marked empty, because we expect it to be merged into its parent,
         * it might no longer be empty after it's reconciled, in which case eviction of its parent
         * would fail. We can either walk the tree multiple times (until it's finally empty), or
         * reconcile each page to get it to its final state before considering if it's an eviction
         * target or will be merged into its parent.
         *
         * Don't limit this test to any particular page type, that tends to introduce bugs when the
         * reconciliation of other page types changes, and there's no advantage to doing so.
         *
         * Eviction can also fail because an update cannot be written. If sessions have disjoint
         * sets of files open, updates in a no-longer-referenced file may not yet be visible, and
         * the write will fail with EBUSY. Our caller handles that error, retrying later.
