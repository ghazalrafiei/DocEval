 * mozILocalization is an internal API used by Localization class for formatting of translation
 * units.
 *
 * There are three main formatting methods:
 *    - formatMessages - formats a list of messages based on the requested keys.
 *    - formatValues   - formats a list of values of messages based on the requested keys.
 *    - formatValue    - formats a single value based on the requested id and args.
 *
 * Each method has a `Sync` variant that can be used if the instance is in the `sync` state.
 * This mode is enabled via passing `true` to `aIsSync` either in `activate` or `onChange` method.
 *
 * When this value is set to `false`, those methods will throw.
