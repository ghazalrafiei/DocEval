 * Helper class for frozen UnicodeSets, implements contains() and span()
 * optimized for BMP code points. Structured to be UTF-8-friendly.
 *
 * Latin-1: Look up bytes.
 * 2-byte characters: Bits organized vertically.
 * 3-byte characters: Use zero/one/mixed data per 64-block in U+0000..U+FFFF,
 *                    with mixed for illegal ranges.
 * Supplementary characters: Binary search over
 * the supplementary part of the parent set's inversion list.
