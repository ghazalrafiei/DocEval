 * LocaleService is a manager of language negotiation in Gecko.
 *
 * It's intended to be the core place for collecting available and
 * requested languages and negotiating them to produce a fallback
 * chain of locales for the application.
 *
 * Client / Server
 *
 * LocaleService may operate in one of two modes:
 *
 *   server
 *     in the server mode, LocaleService is collecting and negotiating
 *     languages. It also subscribes to relevant observers.
 *     There should be at most one server per application instance.
 *
 *   client
 *     in the client mode, LocaleService is not responsible for collecting
 *     or reacting to any system changes. It still distributes information
 *     about locales, but internally, it gets information from the server
 * instance instead of collecting it on its own. This prevents any data
 * desynchronization and minimizes the cost of running the service.
 *
 *   In both modes, all get* methods should work the same way and all
 *   static methods are available.
 *
 *   In the server mode, other components may inform LocaleService about their
 *   status either via calls to set* methods or via observer events.
 *   In the client mode, only the process communication should provide data
 *   to the LocaleService.
 *
 *   At the moment desktop apps use the parent process in the server mode, and
 *   content processes in the client mode.
 *
 * Locale / Language
 *
 * The terms `Locale ID` and `Language ID` are used slightly differently
 * by different organizations. Mozilla uses the term `Language ID` to describe
 * a string that contains information about the language itself, script,
 * region and variant. For example "en-Latn-US-mac" is a correct Language ID.
 *
 * Locale ID contains a Language ID plus a number of extension tags that
 * contain information that go beyond language inforamation such as
 * preferred currency, date/time formatting etc.
 *
 * An example of a Locale ID is `en-Latn-US-x-hc-h12-ca-gregory`
 *
 * At the moment we do not support full extension tag system, but we
 * try to be specific when naming APIs, so the service is for locales,
 * but we negotiate between languages etc.

   * Create (if necessary) and return a raw pointer to the singleton instance.
   * Use this accessor in C++ code that just wants to call a method on the
   * instance, but does not need to hold a reference, as in
   *    nsAutoCString str;
   *    LocaleService::GetInstance()->GetAppLocaleAsLangTag(str);

   * Canonicalize a Unicode Language Identifier string.
   *
   * The operation is:
   *   * Normalizing casing (`eN-Us-Windows` -> `en-US-windows`)
   *   * Switching `_` to `-` (`en_US` -> `en-US`)
   *   * Rejecting invalid identifiers (`e21-X` sets aLocale to `und` and
   * returns false)
   *   * Normalizing Mozilla's `ja-JP-mac` to `ja-JP-macos`
   *   * Cutting off POSIX dot postfix (`en-US.utf8` -> `en-US`)
   *
   * This operation should be used on any external input before
   * it gets used in internal operations.

   * This method should only be called in the client mode.

   * It replaces all the language negotiation and is supposed to be called
   * in order to bring the client LocaleService in sync with the server
   * LocaleService.

   * Currently, it's called by the IPC code.

   * Those two functions allow to trigger cache invalidation on one of the
   * three cached values.
   *
   * In most cases, the functions will be called by the observer in
   * LocaleService itself, but in a couple special cases, we have the
   * other component call this manually instead of sending a global event.
   *
   * If the result differs from the previous list, it will additionally
   * trigger a corresponding event
   *
   * This code should be called only in the server mode..
