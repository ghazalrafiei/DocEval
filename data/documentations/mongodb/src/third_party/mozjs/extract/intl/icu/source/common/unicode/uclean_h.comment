 * \brief C API: Initialize and clean up ICU
 ','line_number':21,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 *  Initialize ICU.
 *
 *  Use of this function is optional.  It is OK to simply use ICU
 *  services and functions without first having initialized
 *  ICU by calling u_init().
 *
 *  u_init() will attempt to load some part of ICU's data, and is
 *  useful as a test for configuration or installation problems that
 *  leave the ICU data inaccessible.  A successful invocation of u_init()
 *  does not, however, guarantee that all ICU data is accessible.
 *
 *  Multiple calls to u_init() cause no harm, aside from the small amount
 *  of time required.
 *
 *  In old versions of ICU, u_init() was required in multi-threaded applications
 *  to ensure the thread safety of ICU.  u_init() is no longer needed for this purpose.
 *
 * @param status An ICU UErrorCode parameter. It must not be <code>NULL</code>.
 *    An Error will be returned if some required part of ICU data can not
 *    be loaded or initialized.
 *    The function returns immediately if the input error code indicates a
 *    failure, as usual.
 *
 * @stable ICU 2.6

['text':'*
 * Clean up the system resources, such as allocated memory or open files,
 * used in all ICU libraries. This will free/delete all memory owned by the
 * ICU libraries, and return them to their original load state. All open ICU
 * items (collators, resource bundles, converters, etc.) must be closed before
 * calling this function, otherwise ICU may not free its allocated memory
 * (e.g. close your converters and resource bundles before calling this
 * function). Generally, this function should be called once just before
 * an application exits. For applications that dynamically load and unload
 * the ICU libraries (relatively uncommon), u_cleanup() should be called
 * just before the library unload.
 * <p>
 * u_cleanup() also clears any ICU heap functions, mutex functions or
 * trace functions that may have been set for the process.  
 * This has the effect of restoring ICU to its initial condition, before
 * any of these override functions were installed.  Refer to
 * u_setMemoryFunctions(), u_setMutexFunctions and 
 * utrace_setFunctions().  If ICU is to be reinitialized after
 * calling u_cleanup(), these runtime override functions will need to
 * be set up again if they are still required.
 * <p>
 * u_cleanup() is not thread safe.  All other threads should stop using ICU
 * before calling this function.
 * <p>
 * Any open ICU items will be left in an undefined state by u_cleanup(),
 * and any subsequent attempt to use such an item will give unpredictable
 * results.
 * <p>
 * After calling u_cleanup(), an application may continue to use ICU by
 * calling u_init().  An application must invoke u_init() first from one single
 * thread before allowing other threads call u_init().  All threads existing
 * at the time of the first thread's call to u_init() must also call
 * u_init() themselves before continuing with other ICU operations.  
 * <p>
 * The use of u_cleanup() just before an application terminates is optional,
 * but it should be called only once for performance reasons. The primary
 * benefit is to eliminate reports of memory or resource leaks originating
 * in ICU code from the results generated by heap analysis tools.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Use this function with great care!</strong>
 * </p>
