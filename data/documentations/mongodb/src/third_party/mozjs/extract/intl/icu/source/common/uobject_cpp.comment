 * Default implementation of UMemory::new/delete
 * using uprv_malloc() and uprv_free().
 *
 * For testing, this is used together with a list of imported symbols to verify
 * that ICU is not using the global ::new and ::delete operators.
 *
 * These operators can be implemented like this or any other appropriate way
 * when customizing ICU for certain environments.
 * Whenever ICU is customized in binary incompatible ways please be sure
 * to use library name suffixes to distinguish such libraries from
 * the standard build.
 *
 * Instead of just modifying these C++ new/delete operators, it is usually best
 * to modify the uprv_malloc()/uprv_free()/uprv_realloc() functions in cmemory.c.
 *
 * Memory test on Windows/MSVC 6:
 * The global operators new and delete look as follows:
 *   04F 00000000 UNDEF  notype ()    External     | ??2@YAPAXI@Z (void * __cdecl operator new(unsigned int))
 *   03F 00000000 UNDEF  notype ()    External     | ??3@YAXPAX@Z (void __cdecl operator delete(void *))
 *
 * These lines are from output generated by the MSVC 6 tool dumpbin with
 * dumpbin /symbols *.obj
 *
 * ??2@YAPAXI@Z and ??3@YAXPAX@Z are the linker symbols in the .obj
 * files and are imported from msvcrtd.dll (in a debug build).
 *
 * Make sure that with the UMemory operators new and delete defined these two symbols
 * do not appear in the dumpbin /symbols output for the ICU libraries!
 *
 * If such a symbol appears in the output then look in the preceding lines in the output
 * for which file and function calls the global new or delete operator,
 * and replace with uprv_malloc/uprv_free.
