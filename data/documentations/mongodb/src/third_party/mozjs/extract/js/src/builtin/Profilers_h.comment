 * Start any profilers that are available and have been configured on for this

 * The profileName is used by some profilers to describe the current profiling
 * run. It may be used for part of the filename of the output, but the
 * specifics depend on the profiler. Many profilers will ignore it. Passing in
 * nullptr is legal; some profilers may use it to output to stdout or similar.
