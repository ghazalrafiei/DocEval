 * Class which represents a heap based priority queue using a vector.
 * Inserting elements and removing the highest priority one are both O(log n).
 *
 * Template parameters are the same as for Vector, with the addition that P
 * must have a static priority(const T&) method which returns higher numbers
 * for higher priority elements.

['text':'
   * Elements of the vector encode a binary tree:
   *
   *      0
   *    1   2
   *   3 4 5 6
   *
   * The children of element N are (2N + 1) and (2N + 2).
   * The parent of element N is (N - 1) / 2.
   *
   * Each element has higher priority than its children.
