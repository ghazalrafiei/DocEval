 * Functionality for issuing and handling warnings.
 *
 * Warnings are situations that aren't inherently full-blown errors (and perhaps
 * for spec compliance *can't* be), but that may represent dubious programming
 * practice that embeddings may wish to know about.
 *
 * SpiderMonkey recognizes an unspecified set of syntactic patterns and runtime
 * behaviors as triggering a warning.  Embeddings may also recognize and report
 * additional warnings.

 * destroyed.
