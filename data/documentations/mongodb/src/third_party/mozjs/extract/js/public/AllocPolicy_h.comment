 * the lifetime of the container, this policy may only be used for containers
 * whose lifetime is a shorter than the given JSContext.

 * This is currently used for allocating source buffers for parsing. Since these
 * are temporary and will not be freed by GC, the memory is not tracked by the
 * usual accounting.
