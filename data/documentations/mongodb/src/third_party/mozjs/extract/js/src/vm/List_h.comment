 * The List specification type, ECMA-262 6.2.1.
 * <https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-list-and-record-specification-type>
 *
 * Lists are simple mutable sequences of values. Many standards use them.
 * Abstractly, they're not objects; they don't have properties or prototypes;
 * they're for internal specification use only. ListObject is our most direct
 * implementation of a List: store the values in the slots of a JSObject.
 *
 * We often implement Lists in other ways. For example, builtin/Utilities.js
 * contains a completely unrelated List constructor that's used in self-hosted
 * code. And AsyncGeneratorObject optimizes away the ListObject in the common
 * case where its internal queue never holds more than one element.
 *
 * ListObjects must not be exposed to content scripts.

   * Adds |value| and |size| elements to a list consisting of (value, size)
   * pairs stored in successive elements.
   *
   * This function is intended for use by streams code's queue-with-sizes data
   * structure and related operations.  See builtin/streams/QueueWithSizes*.
   * (You *could* use this on any list of even length without issue, but it's
   * hard to imagine realistic situations where you'd want to...)
