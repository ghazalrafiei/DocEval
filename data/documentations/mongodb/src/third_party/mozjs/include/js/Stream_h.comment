 * JSAPI functions and callbacks related to WHATWG Stream objects.
 *
 * Much of the API here mirrors the standard algorithms and standard JS methods
 * of the objects defined in the Streams standard. One difference is that the
 * functionality of the JS controller object is exposed to C++ as functions
 * taking ReadableStream instances instead, for convenience.
 ','line_number':7,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Abstract base class for external underlying sources.
 *
 * The term "underlying source" is defined in the Streams spec:
 *   https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#underlying-source
 *
 * A `ReadableStreamUnderlyingSource` is an underlying source that is
 * implemented in C++ rather than JS. It can be passed to
 * `JS::NewReadableExternalSourceStreamObject` to create a custom,
 * embedding-defined ReadableStream.
 *
 * There are several API difference between this class and the standard API for
 * underlying sources implemented in JS:
 *
 * -   JS underlying sources can be either byte sources or non-byte sources.
 *     External underlying source are always byte sources.
 *
 * -   The C++ API does not bother with controller objects. Instead of using
 *     controller methods, the underlying source directly calls API functions
 *     like JS::ReadableStream{UpdateDataAvailableFromSource,Close,Error}.
 *
 * -   External readable streams are optimized to allow the embedding to
 *     interact with them with a minimum of overhead: chunks aren't enqueued as
 *     individual typed arrays; instead, the embedding only updates the amount
 *     of data available using
 *     JS::ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource. When JS requests data
 *     from a reader, writeIntoReadRequestBuffer is invoked, asking the
 *     embedding to write data directly into the buffer we're about to hand to
 *     JS.
 *
 * -   The C++ API provides extra callbacks onClosed() and onErrored().
 *
 * -   This class has a `finalize()` method, because C++ cares about lifetimes.
 *
 * Additionally, ReadableStreamGetExternalUnderlyingSource can be used to get
 * the pointer to the underlying source. This locks the stream until it is
 * released again using JS::ReadableStreamReleaseExternalUnderlyingSource.
 *
 * Embeddings can use this to optimize away the JS `ReadableStream` overhead
 * when an embedding-defined C++ stream is passed to an embedding-defined C++
 * consumer. For example, consider a ServiceWorker piping a `fetch` Response
 * body to a TextDecoder. Instead of copying chunks of data into JS typed array
 * buffers and creating a Promise per chunk, only to immediately resolve the
 * Promises and read the data out again, the embedding can directly feed the
 * incoming data to the TextDecoder.
 *
 * Compartment safety: All methods (except `finalize`) receive `cx` and
 * `stream` arguments. SpiderMonkey enters the realm of the stream object
 * before invoking these methods, so `stream` is never a wrapper. Other
 * arguments may be wrappers.
 ','line_number':30,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
   * Invoked whenever a reader desires more data from this source.
   *
   * The given `desiredSize` is the absolute size, not a delta from the
   * previous desired size.
   ','line_number':85,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
   * Invoked to cause the embedding to fill the given `buffer` with data from
   * this underlying source.
   *
   * This is called only after the embedding has updated the amount of data
   * available using JS::ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource. If at
   * least one read request is pending when
   * JS::ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource is called, this method
   * is invoked immediately from under the call to
   * JS::ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource. If not, it is invoked
   * if and when a new read request is made.
   *
   * Note: This method *must not cause GC*, because that could potentially
   * invalidate the `buffer` pointer.
   ','line_number':94,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
   * Invoked in reaction to the ReadableStream being canceled. This is
   * equivalent to the `cancel` method on non-external underlying sources
   * provided to the ReadableStream constructor in JavaScript.
   *
   * The underlying source may free up some resources in this method, but
   * `*this` must not be destroyed until `finalize()` is called.

   * must be prepared for `finalize()` to be invoked from any thread.

['text':'*
 * Returns a new instance of the ReadableStream builtin class in the current
 * compartment, configured as a default stream.
 * If a |proto| is passed, that gets set as the instance's [[Prototype]]
 * instead of the original value of |ReadableStream.prototype|.
 ','line_number':158,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
 * Returns a new instance of the ReadableStream builtin class in the current
 * compartment.
 *
 * The instance is a byte stream backed by an embedding-provided underlying
 * source, using the virtual methods of `underlyingSource` as callbacks. The
 * embedding must ensure that `*underlyingSource` lives as long as the new
 * stream object. The JS engine will call the finalize() method when the stream
 * object is destroyed.
 *
 * `nsISupportsObject_alreadyAddreffed` is an optional pointer that can be used
 * to make the new stream participate in Gecko's cycle collection. Here are the
 * rules for using this parameter properly:
 *
 * -   `*underlyingSource` must not be a cycle-collected object. (It would lead
 *     to memory leaks as the cycle collector would not be able to collect
 *     cycles containing that object.)
 *
 * -   `*underlyingSource` must not contain nsCOMPtrs that point to cycle-
 *     collected objects. (Same reason.)
 *
 * -   `*underlyingSource` may contain a pointer to a single cycle-collected
 *     object.
 *
 * -   The pointer may be stored in `*underlyingSource` as a raw pointer.
 *
 * -   The pointer to the nsISupports interface of the same object must be
 *     passed as the `nsISupportsObject_alreadyAddreffed` parameter to this
 *     function. (This is how the cycle collector knows about it, so omitting
 *     this would again cause leaks.)
 *
 * If `proto` is non-null, it is used as the instance's [[Prototype]] instead
 * of the original value of `ReadableStream.prototype`.

 * Returns the embedding-provided underlying source of the given |stream|.
