 * Perform |obj.length = length| as if in strict mode code, with a fast path for
 * the case where |obj| is an Array.
 *
 * This operation is exactly and only assigning to a "length" property.  In
 * general, it can invoke an existing "length" setter, throw if the property is
 * non-writable, or do anything else a property-set operation might do.

 * ES6 7.2.2.
 *
 * Returns false on failure, otherwise returns true and sets |*isArray|
 * indicating whether the object passes ECMAScript's IsArray test.  This is the
 * same test performed by |Array.isArray|.
 *
 * This is NOT the same as asking whether |obj| is an Array or a wrapper around
 * one.  If |obj| is a proxy created by |Proxy.revocable()| and has been
 * revoked, or if |obj| is a proxy whose target (at any number of hops) is a
 * revoked proxy, this method throws a TypeError and returns false.

 * Identical to IsArray above, but the nature of the object (if successfully
 * determined) is communicated via |*answer|.  In particular this method
 * returns true and sets |*answer = IsArrayAnswer::RevokedProxy| when called on
 * a revoked proxy.
 *
 * Most users will want the overload above, not this one.
