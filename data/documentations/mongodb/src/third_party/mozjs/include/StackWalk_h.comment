 * Returns the position of the Program Counter for the caller of the current
 * function. This is meant to be used to feed the aFirstFramePC argument to
 * MozStackWalk or MozWalkTheStack*, and should be used in the last function
 * that should be skipped in the trace, and passed down to MozStackWalk or
 * MozWalkTheStack*, through any intermediaries.
 *
 * THIS DOES NOT 100% RELIABLY GIVE THE CALLER PC, but marking functions
 * calling this macro with MOZ_NEVER_INLINE gets us close. In cases it doesn't
 * give the caller's PC, it may give the caller of the caller, or its caller,
 * etc. depending on tail call optimization.
 *
 * Past versions of stackwalking relied on passing a constant number of frames
 * to skip to MozStackWalk or MozWalkTheStack, which fell short in more cases
 * (inlining of intermediaries, tail call optimization).
