 * Like MozStackWalk, but walks the stack for another thread.
 * Call aCallback for each stack frame on the current thread, from
 * the caller of MozStackWalk to main (or above).
 *
 * @param aCallback    Same as for MozStackWalk().
 * @param aMaxFrames   Same as for MozStackWalk().
 * @param aClosure     Same as for MozStackWalk().
 * @param aThread      The handle of the thread whose stack is to be walked.
 *                     If 0, walks the current thread.
 * @param aContext     A CONTEXT, presumably obtained with GetThreadContext()
 *                     after suspending the thread with SuspendThread(). If
 *                     null, the CONTEXT will be re-obtained.
