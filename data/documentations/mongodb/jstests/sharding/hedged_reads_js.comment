 * The following starts a parallel shell to run a `count` command against the cluster. The
 * `failCommand` fail-point is enabled on both nodes that are targeted to run the hedged operation.
 * `fp1` ensures the main target blocks the command until the fail-point is disabled. `fp2` makes
 * the hedged target return a `NetworkInterfaceExceededTimeLimit` error code as the result of
 * running the command. This simulates a situation where the hedged operations fail due to network
 * timeouts, while the main operation succeeds.
