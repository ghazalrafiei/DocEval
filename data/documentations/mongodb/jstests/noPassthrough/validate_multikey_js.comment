 * This test validates a reader concurrent with a multikey update observes a proper snapshot of
 * data. Specifically, if the data can be multikey, the in-memory `isMultikey()` method must return
 * true. The `validate` command ensures this relationship.
 *
 * The failpoint used just widens a window, instead of pausing execution. Thus the test is
 * technically non-deterministic. However, if the server had a bug that caused a regression, the
 * non-determinism would cause the test to sometimes pass when it should fail. A properly behaving
 * server should never cause the test to accidentally fail.
