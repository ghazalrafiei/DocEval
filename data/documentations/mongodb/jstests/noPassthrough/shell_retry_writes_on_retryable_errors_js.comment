 * The testCommandIsRetried() function serves as the fixture for writing test cases which run
 * commands against the server and assert that the mongo shell retries them correctly.
 *
 * The 'testFn' parameter is a function that performs an arbitrary number of operations against
 * the database. The command requests that the mongo shell attempts to send to the server
 * (including any command requests which are retried) are then specified as the sole argument to
 * the 'assertFn' parameter.
 *
 * The testFn(enableCapture, disableCapture) function can also selectively turn on and off the
 * capturing of command requests by calling the functions it receives for its first and second
 * parameters, respectively.
