 * Tests that an incomplete rolling index build can be salvaged when building the same index across
 * a replica set when one or more secondaries already have the index built.
 *
 * By default, the commit quorum is "votingMembers", which is all data-bearing replica set members.
 * The issue arises when starting an index build on the primary which the secondaries have already
 * built to completion. The secondaries would treat the "startIndexBuild" oplog entry as a no-op and
 * return immediately. This causes the secondaries to skip voting for the index build to be
 * committed or aborted, which prevents the primary from satisfying the commit quorum. The
 * "setIndexCommitQuorum" command can be used to modify the commit quorum of in-progress index
 * builds to get out of this situation.
 *
 * Note: this is an incorrect way to build indexes, but demonstrates that "setIndexCommitQuorum" can
 * get a user out of this situation if they end up in it.
