 * Test the backup/restore process:
 * - 3 node replica set
 * - Mongo CRUD client
 * - Mongo FSM client
 * - fsyncLock (or stop) Secondary
 * - cp (or rsync) DB files
 * - fsyncUnlock (or start) Secondary
 * - Start mongod as hidden secondary
 * - Wait until new hidden node becomes secondary
 *
 * Some methods for backup used in this test checkpoint the files in the dbpath. This technique will
 * not work for ephemeral storage engines, as they do not store any data in the dbpath.
