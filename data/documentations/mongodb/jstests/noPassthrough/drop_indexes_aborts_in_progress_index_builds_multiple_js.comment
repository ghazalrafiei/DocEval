 * Tests that the "dropIndexes" command can abort in-progress index builds. The "dropIndexes"
 * command will only abort in-progress index builds if the user specifies all of the indexes that a
 * single builder is building together, as we can only abort at the index builder granularity level.
 *
 * In this file, we test calling "dropIndexes" with a list of index names, which will be used to
 * abort a single index builder only, which was building all the given indexes.
