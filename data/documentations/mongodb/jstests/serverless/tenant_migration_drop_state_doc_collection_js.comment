 * Starts a migration and then either waits for the failpoint or lets the migration run to
 * completion. Next, drops the donor and/or recipient state doc collections and asserts that the
 * migration is no longer running on the donor and/or recipient. Then, retries the migration (with a
 * different migration id if 'retryWithDifferentMigrationId' is true) and verifies that the retry
 * succeeds or fails as expected.
