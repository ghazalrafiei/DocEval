 * findAndModify_update_queue.js
 *
 * A large number of documents are inserted during the workload setup. Each thread repeated updates
 * a document from the collection using the findAndModify command, and stores the _id field of that
 * document in another database. At the end of the workload, the contents of the other database are
 * checked for whether one thread updated the same document as another thread.
 *
 * This workload was designed to reproduce an issue similar to SERVER-18304 for update operations
 * using the findAndModify command where the old version of the document is returned.
