 *
 * One thread (tid 0) is dedicated to writing documents with field 'x' in ascending order into the
 * collection. This thread is also responsible for ensuring the required index on 'x' exists.
 *
 * Other threads do one of the following operations each iteration.
 * 1) Retrieve first 50 documents in descending order with local readConcern from a secondary node.
 * 2) Retrieve first 50 documents in descending order with available readConcern from a secondary
 * node.
 * 3) Retrieve first 50 documents in descending order with majority readConcern from a secondary
 * node.
 * 4) Drop the index on 'x'.
 * 5) Drop the collection.
 *
 * Note that index/collection drop could interrupt the reads, so we need to retry if the read is
 * interrupted.
