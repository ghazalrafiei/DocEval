 * findAndModify_mixed_queue_unindexed.js
 *
 * This workload is a combination of findAndModify_remove_queue_unindexed.js and
 * findAndModify_update_queue_unindexed.js.
 *
 * Each thread contends on the same document as one another by randomly performing either a
 * findAndModify update operation or a findAndModify remove operation. The lack of an index that
 * could satisfy the sort forces the findAndModify operations to scan all the matching documents in
 * order to find the relevant document. This increases the amount of work each findAndModify
 * operation has to do before getting to the matching document, and thus increases the chance of a
 * write conflict because each is trying to update or remove the same document.
 *
 * This workload was designed to reproduce SERVER-21434.
