 * Bulk inserts documents in batches of 100. Randomly selects ~1/10th of existing documents created
 * by the thread and removes them. Queries by the thread that created the documents to verify
 * counts.
 *
 * When the balancer is enabled, the nRemoved result may be inaccurate as
 * a chunk migration may be active, causing the count function to assert.
