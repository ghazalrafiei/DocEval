 *
 * Inserts a bunch of seed data into a time-series collection and then issues a bunch of concurrent
 * partial and full bucket multi-deletes as well as inserts into the same buckets. These are all
 * designed to overlap in their targets, with each completed operation being logged to a side
 * collection. The validation checks that the data remaining in the collection is consistent with
 * the operations that were executed.
