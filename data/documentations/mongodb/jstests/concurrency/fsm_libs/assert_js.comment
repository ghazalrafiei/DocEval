 * Any query that uses getMore is vulnerable to failures that result from the query being killed by
 * a stepdown or similar process before its cursor is exhausted. This includes any aggregation on a
 * sharded cluster, because the mongos always uses getMore to get results from shards.

 * Workloads that issue queries requiring multiple batches or sharded execution plans should detect
 * these errors and ensure that they do not get reported as test failures.
