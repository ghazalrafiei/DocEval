 * Tests that rolling back prepared transactions does not lead to prepare conflicts. These may
 * occur while writing out rollback data files for ops that were done outside of those
 * transactions but are in conflict with their contents. However, since we abort prepared
 * transactions on rollback, such prepare conflicts would be unnecessary. This test therefore
 * verifies that they do not happen.
