 * Initial sync runs in several phases - the first 3 are as follows:
 * 1) fetches the last oplog entry (op_start1) on the source;
 * 2) copies all non-local databases from the source and fetches operations from sync source; and
 * 3) applies operations from the source after op_start1.
 *
 * This test renames a collection on the source between phases 1 and 2, but renameCollection is not
 * supported in initial sync. The secondary will initially fail to apply the command in phase 3
 * and subsequently have to retry the initial sync.
