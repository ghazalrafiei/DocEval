 * This tests that rollback has the ability to retry the 'find' command on the sync source's
 * oplog, which may fail due to transient network errors. It uses the 'failCommand' failpoint
 * to simulate exactly two network failures, so that common point resolution can succeed on the
 * third attempt.
