['text':'*
 * This file tests that if a user initiates a write that becomes a noop either due to being a
 * duplicate operation or due to errors relying on data reads, that we still wait for write concern.
 * This is because we must wait for write concern on the write that made this a noop so that we can
 * be sure it doesn't get rolled back if we acknowledge it.
