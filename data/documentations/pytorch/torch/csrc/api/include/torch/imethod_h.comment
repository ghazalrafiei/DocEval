['text':'
  IMethod provides a portable interface for torch methods, whether
  they are backed by torchscript or python/deploy.

  This is helpful since torchscript methods provide additional information
  (e.g. FunctionSchema, Graph) which aren't available in pure python methods.

  Higher level APIs should prefer depending on this interface rather
  than a specific implementation of it, to promote portability and reuse, and
  avoid unintentional dependencies on e.g. script methods.

  Note: This API is experimental, and may evolve.
