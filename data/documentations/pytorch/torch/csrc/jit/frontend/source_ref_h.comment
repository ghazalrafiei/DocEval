 * SourceRef does two things:
 *   1. Owns a Source object.
 *   2. Serves as lookup key to the owned Source in associative containers, for
 *      runtime data aggregation.
 * We don't want to use std::shared_ptr<Source> directly because we want to
 * support heteogeneous lookup, and also shared_ptr is an implementation detail
 * which should be encapsulated.
