 * Custom class for holding debug information in lowered modules, intended
 * purely for keeping this information to be later serialized outside of the
 * lowered module itself.
 * Its usage pattern is:
 * 1. LoweredModule declares an instance of this class in __backend_debug_info
 * 2. During serialization, __backend_debug_info is used to obtain the debug
 *    information.
 * 3. The contents of LoweredModule.__backend_debug_info are not serialized
 *    within the LoweredModule itself.

 * Dummy instance exists for the following reason:
 * __backend_debug_info is of type BackendDebugInfo which is a torchbind'
 * class backed by cpp class PyTorchBackendDebugInfo.
 * PyTorchBackendDebugInfo, depends on ir.h., scope.h, source_range etc.
 * We dont include this on lite interpreter side. Thus on lite interpreter side
 * we cannot have valid definition of PyTorchBackendDebugInfo. However we do not
 * need valid instance of __backend_debug_info in lite interpreter anyway as we
 * dont serialize this info as part of LowerdModule as mentioned ealrier.
 * However since LoweredModule has registered attribute of __backend_debug_info
 * we still need to make sure that BackendDebugInfo is registered with
 * TorchScript. However in this instance it does not have to be backed by
 * PyTorchBackendDebugInfo, so we create a dummy PyTorchBackendDebugInfoDummy
 * just for this purpose.
