 * These ops are defined as alias of Int8Add/Int8AddRelu for compatibility
 * with current production models. In the future these ops will be changed
 * to an equivalent of Sum op, which does reduction of a single argument.
 * We deliberately omit schema for Int8Sum/Int8SumRelu so they can
 * temporary use either legacy or the new semantics depending on the engine.
