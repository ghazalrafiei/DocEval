 * This file provides distributions compatible with
 * ATen/core/DistributionsHelper.h but backed with the std RNG implementation
 * instead of the ATen one.
 *
 * Caffe2 mobile builds currently do not depend on all of ATen so this is
 * required to allow using the faster ATen RNG for normal builds but keep the
 * build size small on mobile. RNG performance typically doesn't matter on
 * mobile builds since the models are small and rarely using random
 * initialization.
