 * We use the 3-region approach described in "Efficient VLSI Implementation of
 * Neural Networks with Hyperbolic Tangent Activation Function", IEEE
 * Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems, Zamanlooy and
 * Mirhassani.
 * The pass region (x < x_pq) is approximated as x.
 * The saturation region (x >= x_sq) is approximated as 1.
 * The processing region (x_pq <= x < x_sq) is divided into sub-ranges and the
 * average value of tanh(x) is used per sub-range.
