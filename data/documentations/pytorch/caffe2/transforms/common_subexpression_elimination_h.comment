 * Common Subexpression Elimination
 *
 * This transforms looks for specific operators (denoted by allowed_ops_),
 * and removes unnecessary repetition of that operator.
 *
 * Consider some operator of X, that reads from blob b_ written to by W.
 * X_a and X_b read the output of X. However, another operator Y, is the same
 * type as X, has the same arguments as X, and reads from the same input b_,
 * written to by W. It's output is the same as X. Y_a, Y_b, and Y_c read from Y.
 *
 * Then, we can eliminate the common subexpressions X and Y, and merge them to
 * Z, where X_a, X_b, Y_a, Y_b, and Y_c all read from Z.
 *
 *
 * TODO(benz): Fix the error to not match nodes that write to external output.
