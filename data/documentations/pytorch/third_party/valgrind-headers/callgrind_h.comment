['text':' !! ABIWARNING !! ABIWARNING !! ABIWARNING !! ABIWARNING !!
   This enum comprises an ABI exported by Valgrind to programs
   which use client requests.  DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THESE
   ENTRIES, NOR DELETE ANY -- add new ones at the end.

   The identification ('C','T') for Callgrind has historical
   reasons: it was called "Calltree" before. Besides, ('C','G') would
   clash with cachegrind.
 ','line_number':64,'multiline':True]
['text':' Dump current state of cost centers, and zero them afterwards ','line_number':84,'multiline':True]
['text':' Dump current state of cost centers, and zero them afterwards.
   The argument is appended to a string stating the reason which triggered
   the dump. This string is written as a description field into the
   profile data dump. ','line_number':89,'multiline':True]
['text':' Zero cost centers ','line_number':97,'multiline':True]
['text':' Toggles collection state.
   The collection state specifies whether the happening of events
   should be noted or if they are to be ignored. Events are noted
   by increment of counters in a cost center ','line_number':102,'multiline':True]
['text':' Start full callgrind instrumentation if not already switched on.
   When cache simulation is done, it will flush the simulated cache;
   this will lead to an artificial cache warmup phase afterwards with
   cache misses which would not have happened in reality. ','line_number':110,'multiline':True]
['text':' Stop full callgrind instrumentation if not already switched off.
   This flushes Valgrinds translation cache, and does no additional
   instrumentation afterwards, which effectivly will run at the same
   speed as the "none" tool (ie. at minimal slowdown).
   Use this to bypass Callgrind aggregation for uninteresting code parts.
   To start Callgrind in this mode to ignore the setup phase, use
   the option "--instr-atstart=no". ','line_number':118,'multiline':True]
