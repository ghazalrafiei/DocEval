 * Implements a snapshot testing utility. ⚠️ This is async! ⚠️
 *
 * The first time a snapshot test is run, it'll record the value it's called
 * with as the expected value. Subsequent runs will fail if the value differs,
 * but the snapshot can be regenerated by hand or using the Selfhost Test
 * Provider Extension which'll offer to update it.
 *
 * The snapshot will be associated with the currently running test and stored
 * in a `__snapshots__` directory next to the test file, which is expected to
 * be the first `.test.js` file in the callstack.
