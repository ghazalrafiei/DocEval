 * Computing the hover is very fine tuned.
 *
 * Suppose the hover delay is 300ms (the default). Then, when resting the mouse at an anchor:
 * - at 150ms, the async computation is triggered (i.e. semantic hover)
 *   - if async results already come in, they are not rendered yet.
 * - at 300ms, the sync computation is triggered (i.e. decorations, markers)
 *   - if there are sync or async results, they are rendered.
 * - at 900ms, if the async computation hasn't finished, a "Loading..." result is added.
