 * Stores the states at the start of each line and keeps track of which lines
 * must be re-tokenized. Also uses state equality to quickly validate lines
 * that don't need to be re-tokenized.
 *
 * For example, when typing on a line, the line gets marked as needing to be tokenized.
 * Once the line is tokenized, the end state is checked for equality against the begin
 * state of the next line. If the states are equal, tokenization doesn't need to run
 * again over the rest of the file. If the states are not equal, the next line gets marked
 * as needing to be tokenized.
