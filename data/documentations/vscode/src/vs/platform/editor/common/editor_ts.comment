['text':'*
	 * A optional hint to signal in which context the editor opens.
	 *
	 * If configured to be `EditorOpenSource.USER`, this hint can be
	 * used in various places to control the experience. For example,

	 * inform about this in a modal dialog. If the editor opened through
	 * some background task, the notification would show in the background,
	 * not as a modal dialog.
