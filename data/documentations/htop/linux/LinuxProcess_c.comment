[1] Note that before kernel 2.6.26 a process that has not asked for
an io priority formally uses "none" as scheduling class, but the
io scheduler will treat such processes as if it were in the best
effort class. The priority within the best effort class will  be
dynamically  derived  from  the  cpu  nice level of the process:
io_priority = (cpu_nice + 20) / 5. -- From ionice(1) man page
