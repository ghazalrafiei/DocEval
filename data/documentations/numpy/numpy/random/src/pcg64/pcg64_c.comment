 * The method used here is based on Brown, "Random Number Generation
 * with Arbitrary Stride,", Transactions of the American Nuclear
 * Society (Nov. 1994).  The algorithm is very similar to fast
 * exponentiation.
 *
 * Even though delta is an unsigned integer, we can pass a
 * signed integer to go backwards, it just goes "the long way round".
