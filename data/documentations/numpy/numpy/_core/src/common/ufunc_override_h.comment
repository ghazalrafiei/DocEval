 * Check whether an object has __array_ufunc__ defined on its class and it

 * __array_ufunc__ is not the same as that of ndarray.
 *
 * Returns a new reference, the value of type(obj).__array_ufunc__ if it
 * exists and is different from that of ndarray, and NULL otherwise.

 * Get possible out argument from kwds, and returns the number of outputs

 *
 * Returns 0 if no outputs found, -1 if kwds is not a dict (with an error set).
