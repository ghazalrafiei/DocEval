['text':'
 * This flag is used to mark arrays which we would like to, in the future,
 * turn into views. It causes a warning to be issued on the first attempt to
 * write to the array (but the write is allowed to succeed).
 *
 * This flag is for internal use only, and may be removed in a future release,
 * which is why the #define is not exposed to user code. Currently it is set
 * on arrays returned by ndarray.diagonal.
 ','line_number':24,'multiline':True]
['text':'
 * These flags are used internally to indicate an array that was previously
 * a Python scalar (int, float, complex).  The dtype of such an array should
 * be considered as any integer, floating, or complex rather than the explicit
 * dtype attached to the array.
 *
 * These flags must only be used in local context when the array in question
 * is not returned.  Use three flags, to avoid having to double check the
 * actual dtype when the flags are used.
 ','line_number':36,'multiline':True]
['text':'
 * Mark that this was a huge int which was turned into an object array (or
 * unsigned/non-default integer array), but then replaced by a temporary
 * array for further processing. This flag is only used in the ufunc machinery
 * where it is tricky to cover correctly all type resolution paths.
