 * Structure of the ArrayMethod. This structure should probably not be made
 * public. If necessary, we can make certain operations on it public
 * (e.g. to allow users indirect access to `get_strided_loop`).
 *
 * NOTE: In some cases, it may not be clear whether information should be
 * stored here or on the bound version. E.g. `nin` and `nout` (and in the
 * future the gufunc `signature`) is already stored on the ufunc so that
 * storing these here duplicates the information.

 * We will sometimes have to create a ArrayMethod and allow passing it around,

 * The current main purpose of the BoundArrayMethod is that it holds on to the
 * `dtypes` (the classes), so that the `ArrayMethod` (e.g. for casts) will
 * not create references cycles.  In principle, it could hold any information
 * which is also stored on the ufunc (and thus does not need to be repeated
