['text':'
 * This object encapsulates a weekmask and normalized holidays list,
 * so that the business day API can use this data without having
 * to normalize it repeatedly. All the data of this object is private
 * and cannot be modified from Python. Copies are made when giving
 * the weekmask and holidays data to Python code.

['text':'
 * Converts a Python input into a non-normalized list of holidays.

 * IMPORTANT: This function can't do the normalization, because it doesn't
 *            know the weekmask. You must call 'normalize_holiday_list'
 *            on the result before using it.
