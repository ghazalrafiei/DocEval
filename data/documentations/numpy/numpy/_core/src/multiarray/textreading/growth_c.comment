['text':'
 * Helper function taking the size input and growing it (based on min_grow).
 * The current scheme is a minimum growth and a general growth by 25%
 * overallocation.  This is then capped at 2**20 elements, as that propels us
 * in the range of large page sizes (so it is presumably more than enough).
 *
 * It further multiplies it with `itemsize` and ensures that all results fit
 * into an `npy_intp`.
 * Returns -1 if any overflow occurred or the result would not fit.
 * The user has to ensure the input is ssize_t but not negative.
