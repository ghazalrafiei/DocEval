 * Fetch custom converters for the builtin NumPy DTypes (or the generic one).
 * Structured DTypes get unpacked and `object` uses the generic method.

 * TODO: This should probably be moved on the DType object in some form,
 *       to allow user DTypes to define their own converters.

 * Note that the function cleans up `ft` on error.  If `num_field_types < 0`
 * cleanup has already happened in the internal call.

 * Prepare the "field_types" for the given dtypes/descriptors.  Currently,
 * we copy the itemsize, but the main thing is that we check for custom
 * converters.

         * This could probably be allowed, but NumPy absorbs the dimensions
         * so it is an awkward corner case that probably never really worked.
