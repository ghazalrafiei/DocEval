    How parsing quoted fields works:

    For quoting to be activated, the first character of the field
    must be the quote character (after taking into account
    ignore_leading_spaces).  While quoting is active, delimiters
    are treated as regular characters, not delimiters.  Quoting is
    deactivated by the second occurrence of the quote character.  An
    exception is the occurrence of two consecutive quote characters,
    which is treated as a literal occurrence of a single quote character.
    E.g. (with delimiter=',' and quote='"'):
        12.3,"New York, NY","3'2"""
    The second and third fields are `New York, NY` and `3'2"`.

    If a non-delimiter occurs after the closing quote, the quote is
    ignored and parsing continues with quoting deactivated.  Quotes
    that occur while quoting is not activated are not handled specially;
    they become part of the data.
    E.g:
        12.3,"ABC"DEF,XY"Z
    The second and third fields are `ABCDEF` and `XY"Z`.

    Note that the second field of
        12.3,"ABC"   ,4.5
    is `ABC   `.  Currently there is no option to ignore whitespace
    at the end of a field.

 * This tokenizer always copies the full "row" (all tokens).  This makes
 * two things easier:
 * 1. It means that every word is guaranteed to be followed by a NUL character
 *    (although it can include one as well).
 * 2. If usecols are used we can sniff the first row easier by parsing it
 *    fully.  Further, usecols can be negative so we may not know which row we
 *    need up-front.
 *
 * The tokenizer could grow the ability to skip fields and check the
 * maximum number of fields when known, it is unclear that this is worthwhile.
 *
 * Unlike some tokenizers, this one tries to work in chunks and copies
 * data in chunks as well.  The hope is that this makes multiple light-weight
 * loops rather than a single heavy one, to allow e.g. quickly scanning for the
 * end of a field.  Copying chunks also means we usually only check once per
 * field whether the buffer is large enough.
 * Different choices are possible, this one seems to work well, though.
 *
 * The core (main part) of the tokenizer is specialized for the three Python
 * unicode flavors UCS1, UCS2, and UCS4 as a worthwhile optimization.

     * We always start a new field (at the very beginning and whenever a

     * This gives us two scenarios where we need to ignore the last field

     * 1. If there is exactly one empty (unquoted) field, the whole line is
     *    empty.
     * 2. If we are splitting on whitespace we always ignore a last empty
     *    field to match Python's splitting: `" 1 ".split()`.
