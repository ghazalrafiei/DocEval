['text':'
  This example demonstrates how to compile and render EJS templates in the
  browser. It is usually recommended to always embed a precompiled function
  in the HTML, rather than compile it on-the-fly, but this demonstrates that
  it is possible.
  To use this example, first run `jake build` in the EJS root directory to
  produce the client-side ejs.js and ejs.min.js. Alternatively, you can
  download the prebuilt client scripts (both minified and not) in GitHub
  releases.
