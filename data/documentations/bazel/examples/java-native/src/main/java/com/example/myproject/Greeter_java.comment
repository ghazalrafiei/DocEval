 * Prints a greeting which can be customized by building with resources and/or passing in command-
 * line arguments.
 *
 * <p>Building and running this file will print "Hello world". Build and run the
 * //examples/java-native/src/main/java/com/example/myproject:hello-world target to demonstrate
 * this.</p>
 *
 * <p>If this is built with a greeting.txt resource included, it will replace "Hello" with the
 * contents of greeting.txt. The
 * //examples/java-native/src/main/java/com/example/myproject:hello-resources target demonstrates
 * this.</p>
 *
 * <p>If arguments are passed to the binary on the command line, the first argument will replace
 * "world" in the output. See //examples/java-native/src/test/java/com/example/myproject:hello's
 * argument test.</p>
