 * This application illustrates the use of annotations for configuring ProGuard.
 *
 * You can compile it with:
 *     javac -classpath ../lib/annotations.jar NativeCallBack.java
 * You can then process it with:
 *     java -jar ../../../lib/proguard.jar @ ../examples.pro
 *
 * The annotation will preserve the class and its main method,
 * as a result of the specifications in lib/annotations.pro.

     * Suppose this is a native method that computes an answer.
     *
     * The -keep option for native methods in the regular ProGuard
     * configuration will make sure it is not removed or renamed when
     * processing this code.
     ','line_number':17,'multiline':True]
['text':'*
     * Suppose this method is called back from the above native method.
     *
     * ProGuard would remove it, because it is not referenced from java.
     * The annotation will make sure it is preserved anyhow.
