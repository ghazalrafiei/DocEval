 * This visitor removes all members it visits in a ProgramClass.
 *
 * It should be used in two steps:
 * - in the first step, the collection step, all program fields to be removed
 *   should be visited.
 * - in the second step, the removal step, the program class containing the
 *   program fields should be visited. This will actually delete all
 *   collected fields.
 *
 * For example, to remove all fields in a program class:
 *
 *   MemberRemover remover = new MemberRemover();
 *   programClass.fieldsAccept(remover);
 *   programClass.accept(remover);
