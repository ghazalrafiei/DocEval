   Examine all possible prefix codes for a given number of symbols and a
   maximum code length in bits to determine the maximum table size for zlib's
   inflate. Only complete prefix codes are counted.

   Two codes are considered distinct if the vectors of the number of codes per
   length are not identical. So permutations of the symbol assignments result
   in the same code for the counting, as do permutations of the assignments of
   the bit values to the codes (i.e. only canonical codes are counted).

   We build a code from shorter to longer lengths, determining how many symbols
   are coded at each length. At each step, we have how many symbols remain to
   be coded, what the last code length used was, and how many bit patterns of
   that length remain unused. Then we add one to the code length and double the
   number of unused patterns to graduate to the next code length. We then
   assign all portions of the remaining symbols to that code length that
   preserve the properties of a correct and eventually complete code. Those
   properties are: we cannot use more bit patterns than are available; and when
   all the symbols are used, there are exactly zero possible bit patterns left
   unused.

   The inflate Huffman decoding algorithm uses two-level lookup tables for
   speed. There is a single first-level table to decode codes up to root bits
   in length (root == 9 for literal/length codes and root == 6 for distance
   codes, in the current inflate implementation). The base table has 1 << root
   entries and is indexed by the next root bits of input. Codes shorter than
   root bits have replicated table entries, so that the correct entry is
   pointed to regardless of the bits that follow the short code. If the code is
   longer than root bits, then the table entry points to a second-level table.
   The size of that table is determined by the longest code with that root-bit
   prefix. If that longest code has length len, then the table has size 1 <<
   (len - root), to index the remaining bits in that set of codes. Each
   subsequent root-bit prefix then has its own sub-table. The total number of
   table entries required by the code is calculated incrementally as the number
   of codes at each bit length is populated. When all of the codes are shorter
   than root bits, then root is reduced to the longest code length, resulting
   in a single, smaller, one-level table.

   The inflate algorithm also provides for small values of root (relative to
   the log2 of the number of symbols), where the shortest code has more bits
   than root. In that case, root is increased to the length of the shortest
   code. This program, by design, does not handle that case, so it is verified
   that the number of symbols is less than 1 << (root + 1).

   In order to speed up the examination (by about ten orders of magnitude for
   the default arguments), the intermediate states in the build-up of a code
   are remembered and previously visited branches are pruned. The memory
   required for this will increase rapidly with the total number of symbols and
   the maximum code length in bits. However this is a very small price to pay
   for the vast speedup.

   First, all of the possible prefix codes are counted, and reachable
   intermediate states are noted by a non-zero count in a saved-results array.
   Second, the intermediate states that lead to (root + 1) bit or longer codes
   are used to look at all sub-codes from those junctures for their inflate
   memory usage. (The amount of memory used is not affected by the number of
   codes of root bits or less in length.)  Third, the visited states in the
   construction of those sub-codes and the associated calculation of the table
   size is recalled in order to avoid recalculating from the same juncture.
   Beginning the code examination at (root + 1) bit codes, which is enabled by
   identifying the reachable nodes, accounts for about six of the orders of
   magnitude of improvement for the default arguments. About another four
   orders of magnitude come from not revisiting previous states. Out of
   approximately 2x10^16 possible prefix codes, only about 2x10^6 sub-codes
   need to be examined to cover all of the possible table memory usage cases
   for the default arguments of 286 symbols limited to 15-bit codes.

   Note that the uintmax_t type is used for counting. It is quite easy to
   exceed the capacity of an eight-byte integer with a large number of symbols
   and a large maximum code length, so multiple-precision arithmetic would need
   to replace the integer arithmetic in that case. This program will abort if
   an overflow occurs. The big_t type identifies where the counting takes
   place.

   The uintmax_t type is also used for calculating the number of possible codes
   remaining at the maximum length. This limits the maximum code length to the
   number of bits in a long long minus the number of bits needed to represent
   the symbols in a flat code. The code_t type identifies where the bit-pattern
   counting takes place.

['text':' The array for saving results, num[], is indexed with this triplet:

      syms: number of symbols remaining to code
      left: number of available bit patterns at length len
      len: number of bits in the codes currently being assigned

   Those indices are constrained thusly when saving results:

      syms: 3..totsym (totsym == total symbols to code)
      left: 2..syms - 1, but only the evens (so syms == 8 -> 2, 4, 6)
      len: 1..max - 1 (max == maximum code length in bits)

   syms == 2 is not saved since that immediately leads to a single code. left
   must be even, since it represents the number of available bit patterns at
   the current length, which is double the number at the previous length. left
   ends at syms-1 since left == syms immediately results in a single code.
   (left > sym is not allowed since that would result in an incomplete code.)
   len is less than max, since the code completes immediately when len == max.

   The offset into the array is calculated for the three indices with the first
   one (syms) being outermost, and the last one (len) being innermost. We build
   the array with length max-1 lists for the len index, with syms-3 of those
   for each symbol. There are totsym-2 of those, with each one varying in
   length as a function of sym. See the calculation of index in map() for the
   index, and the calculation of size in main() for the size of the array.

   For the deflate example of 286 symbols limited to 15-bit codes, the array
   has 284,284 entries, taking up 2.17 MB for an 8-byte big_t. More than half
   of the space allocated for saved results is actually used -- not all
   possible triplets are reached in the generation of valid prefix codes.
 ','line_number':123,'multiline':True]
['text':' The array for tracking visited states, done[], is itself indexed identically
   to the num[] array as described above for the (syms, left, len) triplet.
   Each element in the array is further indexed by the (mem, rem) doublet,
   where mem is the amount of inflate table space used so far, and rem is the
   remaining unused entries in the current inflate sub-table. Each indexed
   element is simply one bit indicating whether the state has been visited or
   not. Since the ranges for mem and rem are not known a priori, each bit
   vector is of a variable size, and grows as needed to accommodate the visited
   states. mem and rem are used to calculate a single index in a triangular
   array. Since the range of mem is expected in the default case to be about
   ten times larger than the range of rem, the array is skewed to reduce the
   memory usage, with eight times the range for mem than for rem. See the
   calculations for offset and bit in been_here() for the details.

   For the deflate example of 286 symbols limited to 15-bit codes, the bit
   vectors grow to total 5.5 MB, in addition to the 4.3 MB done array itself.
