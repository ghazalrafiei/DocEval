 * The StarlarkCallable interface is implemented by all Starlark values that may be called from
 * Starlark like a function, including built-in functions and methods, Starlark functions, and
 * application-defined objects (such as rules, aspects, and providers in Bazel).
 *
 * <p>It defines two methods: {@code fastcall}, for performance, or {@code call} for convenience. By
 * default, {@code fastcall} delegates to {@code call}, and call throws an exception, so an
 * implementer may override either one.

   * <p>Do not call this function directly. Use the {@link Starlark#call} function to make a call,
   * as it handles necessary book-keeping such as maintenance of the call stack, exception handling,
   * and so on.

   * @param thread the StarlarkThread in which the function is called
   * @param args a tuple of the arguments passed by position
   * @param kwargs a new, mutable dict of the arguments passed by keyword. Iteration order is
   *     determined by keyword order in the call expression.

   * Defines the "fast" implementation of function calling for a callable value.
   *
   * <p>Do not call this function directly. Use the {@link Starlark#call} or {@link
   * Starlark#fastcall} function to make a call, as it handles necessary book-keeping such as
   * maintenance of the call stack, exception handling, and so on.
   *
   * <p>The fastcall implementation takes ownership of the two arrays, and may retain them
   * indefinitely or modify them. The caller must not modify or even access the two arrays after
   * making the call.
   *
   * <p>This method defines the low-level or "fast" calling convention. A more convenient interface
   * is provided by the {@link #call} method, which provides a signature analogous to {@code def
   * f(*args, **kwargs)}, or possibly the "self-call" feature of the {@link StarlarkMethod#selfCall}
   * annotation mechanism.
   *
   * <p>The default implementation forwards the call to {@code call}, after rejecting any duplicate
   * named arguments. Other implementations of this method should similarly reject duplicates.
   *
   * <p>See {@link Starlark#fastcall} for basic information about function calls.
   *
   * @param thread the StarlarkThread in which the function is called
   * @param positional a list of positional arguments
