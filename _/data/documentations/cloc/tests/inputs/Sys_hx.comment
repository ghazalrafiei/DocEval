	This class gives you access to many base functionalities of system platforms. Looks in `sys` sub packages for more system APIs.
*','line_number':23,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Print any value on the standard output.
	*','line_number':29,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Print any value on the standard output, followed by a newline.
	*','line_number':34,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns all the arguments that were passed by the commandline.
	*','line_number':39,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns the value of the given environment variable.
	*','line_number':44,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Set the value of the given environment variable.
	*','line_number':49,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns the whole environement variables.
	*','line_number':54,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Suspend the current execution for the given time (in seconds).
	*','line_number':59,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Change the current time locale, which will affect `DateTools.format` date formating.
		Returns true if the locale was successfully changed
	*','line_number':64,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Get the current working directory (usually the one in which the program was started)
	*','line_number':70,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Change the current working directory.
	*','line_number':75,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns the name of the system you are running on. For instance :
			"Windows", "Linux", "BSD" and "Mac" depending on your desktop OS.
	*','line_number':80,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Run the given command. The command output will be printed on the same output as the current process.
		The current process will block until the command terminates and it will return the command result (0 if there was no error).

		Command arguments can be passed in two ways: 1. using `args`, 2. appending to `cmd` and leaving `args` as `null`.

		 1. When using `args` to pass command arguments, each argument will be automatically quoted, and shell meta-characters will be escaped if needed.
		`cmd` should be an executable name that can be located in the `PATH` environment variable, or a path to an executable.

		 2. When `args` is not given or is `null`, command arguments can be appended to `cmd`. No automatic quoting/escaping will be performed. `cmd` should be formatted exactly as it would be when typed at the command line.
		It can run executables, as well as shell commands that are not executables (e.g. on Windows: `dir`, `cd`, `echo` etc).

		Read the `sys.io.Process` api for a more complete way to start background processes.
	*','line_number':86,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Exit the current process with the given error code.
	*','line_number':102,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Gives the most precise timestamp value (in seconds).
	*','line_number':107,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Gives the most precise timestamp value (in seconds) but only account for the actual time spent running on the CPU for the current thread/process.
	*','line_number':112,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns the path to the current executable that we are running.
	*','line_number':117,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns the absolute path to the current program file that we are running.
		Concretely, for an executable binary, it returns the path to the binary.
		For a script (e.g. a PHP file), it returns the path to the script.
	*','line_number':122,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Read a single input character from the standard input (without blocking) and returns it. Setting `echo` to true will also display it on the output.
	*','line_number':129,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns the process standard input, from which you can read what user enters. Usually it will block until the user send a full input line. See `getChar` for an alternative.
	*','line_number':134,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns the process standard output on which you can write.
	*','line_number':139,'multiline':True]['text':'*
		Returns the process standard error on which you can write.
