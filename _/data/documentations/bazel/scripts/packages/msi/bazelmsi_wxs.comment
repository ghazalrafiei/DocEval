','line_number':2,'multiline':True]['text':' Product/@Id is auto-generated so every Bazel version (including release
       candidates) has a unique product GUID. This is fine, all upgrades are
       "Major upgrades" (see
       https://www.firegiant.com/wix/tutorial/upgrades-and-modularization/).

       IMPORTANT: to see the Product GUID of an .msi file:
         1. install the Windows SDK
         2. find the Orca installer underneath (Orca-x86_en-us.msi) and run it
         3. open the .msi file with Orca
         4. open the "Property" table: the "ProductCode" property is the
            generated Product/@Id GUID
  ','line_number':18,'multiline':True]['text':' IMPORTANT: Product/@UpgradeCode must be the same for backwards-compatible
       versions, but a new code is needed when an incompatible release comes.

       Versions with the same UpgradeCode are upgraded: higher versions replace
       lower versions (e.g. version 1.5.2 replaces version 1.0.3). Downgrading
       is not permitted.
       Versions with different UpgradeCodes can co-exist (e.g version 2.0.4rc5
       can co-exist with version 1.2.0).
  ','line_number':31,'multiline':True]['text':' Package/@Id is auto-generated. This is standard practice with WiX,
         although it makes the compilation step ("candle.exe")
         non-deterministic.
         Even if we used a fixed GUID though, the linking step ("light.exe")
         would still be non-deterministic.

         e.g. install 0.28.0rc3 then 0.28.0. Unfortunately we can't easily
         prevent upgrading a release version to its RC version, or upgrading an
         RC with an older RC (because their VERSION and UPGRADE_GUID are both
         the same) but that's an acceptable flaw. ','line_number':124,'multiline':True]
