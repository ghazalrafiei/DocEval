We want to handle the case
   * where a Jar/Zip file contains a preamble (an arbitrary data before the
   * first entry) and 'zip -A' was not called to adjust the offsets, so all
   * the offsets are off by the preamble size. In the 32-bit case (that is,
   * there is no ECD64Locator+ECD64), ECD immediately follows the last CDH,
   * ECD immediately follows the Central Directory, and contains its size, so
   * Central Directory can be found reliably. We then use its stated location,
   * which ECD contains, too, to calculate the preamble size.  In the 64-bit
   * case, there are ECD64 and ECD64Locator records between the end of the
   * Central Directory and the ECD, the calculation is similar, with the
   * exception of the logic to find the actual start of the ECD64.
   * ECD64Locator contains only its position in the file, which is off by
   * preamble size, but does not contain the actual size of ECD64, which in
   * theory is variable (the fixed fields may be followed by some custom data,
   * with the total size saved in ECD64::remaining_size and thus unavailable
   * until we find ECD64.  We assume that the custom data is missing.
