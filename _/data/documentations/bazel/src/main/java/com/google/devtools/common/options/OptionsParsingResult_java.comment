   * Returns a mutable copy of the list of all options that were specified either explicitly or

   * Canonicalizes the list of options that this OptionsParser has parsed.
   *
   * <p>The contract is that if the returned set of options is passed to an options parser with the
   * same options classes, then that will have the same effect as using the original args (which are
   * passed in here), except for cosmetic differences. We do not guarantee that the 'canonical' list
   * is unique, since some flags may have effects unknown to the parser (--config, for Bazel), so we
   * do not reorder flags to further simplify the list.
