 * An object that manages the capability to mutate Starlark objects and their {@link
 * StarlarkThread}s. Collectively, the managed objects are called {@link Freezable}s.
 *
 * <p>Each {@code StarlarkThread}, and each of the mutable Starlark values that are created in that
 * {@code StarlarkThread}, holds a pointer to the same {@code Mutability} instance. Once the {@code
 * StarlarkThread} is done evaluating, its {@code Mutability} is irreversibly closed ("frozen"). At
 * that point, it is no longer possible to change either the bindings in that {@code StarlarkThread}
 * or the state of its objects. This protects each {@code StarlarkThread} from unintentional and
 * unsafe modification.
 *
 * <p>{@code Mutability}s enforce isolation between {@code StarlarkThread}s; it is illegal for an
 * evaluation in one {@code StarlarkThread} to affect the bindings or values of another. In
 * particular, the {@code StarlarkThread} for any Starlark module is frozen before its symbols can
 * be imported for use by another module. Each individual {@code StarlarkThread}'s evaluation is
 * single-threaded, so this isolation also translates to thread safety. Any number of threads may
 * simultaneously access frozen data. (The {@code Mutability} itself is also thread-safe if and only
 * if it is frozen.}
 *
 * <p>Although the mutability pointer of a {@code Freezable} contains some debugging information
 * about its context, this should not affect the {@code Freezable}'s semantics. From a behavioral
 * point of view, the only thing that matters is whether the {@code Mutability} is frozen, not what
 * particular {@code Mutability} object is pointed to.
 *
 * <p>When a Starlark program iterates over a mutable sequence value in a for-loop or comprehension,
 * the sequence value becomes temporarily immutable for the duration of the loop. Conceptually, the
 * value maintains a counter of active iterations, and the interpreter notifies the {@code
 * Freezable} value before and after the loop so that it can alter its counter by calling its {@code
 * updateIteratorCount} method. While the counter value is nonzero, the value should cause all
 * attempts to mutate it to fail. The temporary immutability applies only to the sequence itself,
 * not to its elements. Once a mutable sequence becomes frozen, there is no need to count active
 * iterators (and doing so would be racy as frozen objects may be published to other Starlark
 * threads). The default implementation of {@code updateIteratorCount} uses a set of counters in the
 * Mutability, but a Freezable object may define a more efficient intrusive counter implementation.
 *
 * <p>We follow two disciplines to ensure safety. First, all mutation methods of a Freezable value
 * must confirm that the value's Mutability is not yet frozen, nor is the value temporarily
 * immutable due to active iterators.
 *
 * <p>Second, {@code Mutability}s are created using the try-with-resource style:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (Mutability mutability = Mutability.create(name, ...)) { ... }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * The general pattern is to create a {@code Mutability}, build an {@code StarlarkThread}, mutate
 * that {@code StarlarkThread} and its objects, and possibly return the result from within the
 * {@code try} block, relying on the try-with-resource construct to ensure that everything gets
 * frozen before the result is used. The only code that should create a {@code Mutability} without
 * using try-with-resource is test code that is not part of the Bazel jar.
 *
 * <p>We keep some (unchecked) invariants regarding where {@code Mutability} objects may appear
 * within a compound value.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A compound value can never contain an unfrozen {@code Mutability} for any {@code
 *       StarlarkThread} except the one currently being evaluated.
 *   <li>If a value has the special {@link #IMMUTABLE} {@code Mutability}, all of its contents are
 *       themselves deeply immutable too (i.e. have frozen {@code Mutability}s).
 * </ol>
 *
 * It follows that, if these invariants hold, an unfrozen value cannot appear as the child of a
 * value whose {@code Mutability} is already frozen.
 *
 * <p>There is a special API for freezing individual values rather than whole {@code
 * StarlarkThread}s. Because this API makes it easier to violate the above invariants, you should
 * avoid using it if at all possible; at the moment it is only used for serialization. Under this
 * API, you may call {@link Freezable#unsafeShallowFreeze} to reset a value's {@code Mutability}
 * pointer to be {@link #IMMUTABLE}. This operation has no effect on the {@code Mutability} itself.
 * It is up to the caller to preserve or restore the above invariants by ensuring that any deeply
 * contained values are also frozen. For safety and explicitness, this operation is disallowed
 * unless the {@code Mutability}'s {@link #allowsUnsafeShallowFreeze} method returns true.
