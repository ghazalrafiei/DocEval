 * FileOptions is a set of options that affect the static processing---scanning, parsing, validation
 * (identifier resolution), and compilation---of a single Starlark file. These options affect the
 * language accepted by the frontend (in effect, the dialect), and "code generation", analogous to
 * the command-line options of a typical compiler.
 *
 * <p>Different files within the same application and even executed within the same thread may be
 * subject to different file options. For example, in Bazel, load statements in WORKSPACE files may
 * need to be interleaved with other statements, whereas in .bzl files, load statements must appear
 * all at the top. A single thread may execute a WORKSPACE file and call functions defined in .bzl
 * files.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #DEFAULT} options represent the desired behavior for new uses of Starlark. It is a
 * goal to keep this set of options small and closed. Each represents a language feature, perhaps a
 * deprecated, obscure, or regrettable one. By contrast, {@link StarlarkSemantics} defines a
 * (soon-to-be) open-ended set of options that affect the dynamic behavior of Starlark threads and
 * (mostly application-defined) built-in functions, and particularly attribute selection operations
 * {@code x.f}.

   * During resolution, permit multiple assignments to a given top-level binding, whether file-local
   * or global. However, as usual, you may not create both a file-local and a global binding of the
