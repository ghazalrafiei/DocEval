      @short_description: Portal for inhibiting session transitions

      This simple interface lets sandboxed applications inhibit the user
      session from ending, suspending, idling or getting switched away.

      This documentation describes version 3 of this interface.

        Inhibits a session status changes. To remove the inhibition,
        call org.freedesktop.portal.Request.Close() on the returned
        handle.

        The flags determine what changes are inhibited:

        Creates a monitoring session. While this session is
        active, the caller will receive StateChanged signals
        with updates on the session state.

        A successfully created session can at any time be closed using
        org.freedesktop.portal.Session::Close, or may at any time be closed
        by the portal implementation, which will be signalled via
        #org.freedesktop.portal.Session::Closed.

        This method was added in version 2 of this interface.

        StateChanged:
        @session_handle: Object path for the #org.freedesktop.portal.Session object
        @state: Vardict with information about the session state

        The StateChanged signal is sent to active monitoring sessions when
        the session state changes.

        When the session state changes to 'Query End', clients with active monitoring
        sessions are expected to respond by calling
        org.freedesktop.portal.Inhibit.QueryEndResponse() within a second
        of receiving the StateChanged signal. They may call org.freedesktop.portal.Inhibit.Inhibit()
        first to inhibit logout, to prevent the session from proceeding to the Ending state.

        The following information may get returned in the @state vardict:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>screensaver-active b</term>
            <listitem><para>
              Whether the screensaver is active.

      Acknowledges that the caller received the #org.freedesktop.portal.Inhibit::StateChanged

      signal with the 'Query End' state.
