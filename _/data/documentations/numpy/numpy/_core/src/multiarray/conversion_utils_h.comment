 * Converts an axis parameter into an ndim-length C-array of
 * boolean flags, True for each axis specified.

 * If obj is None, everything is set to True. If obj is a tuple,
 * each axis within the tuple is set to True. If obj is an integer,
 * just that axis is set to True.

 * WARNING: This flag is a bad idea, but was the only way to both
 *   1) Support unpickling legacy pickles with object types.
 *   2) Deprecate (and later disable) usage of O4 and O8
 *
 * The key problem is that the pickled representation unpickles by
 * directly calling the dtype constructor, which has no way of knowing
 * that it is in an unpickle context instead of a normal context without
 * evil global state like we create here.
