 * This file defines most of the machinery in order to wrap an existing ufunc
 * loop for use with a different set of dtypes.
 *
 * There are two approaches for this, one is to teach the NumPy core about
 * the possibility that the loop descriptors do not match exactly the result
 * descriptors.
 * The other is to handle this fully by "wrapping", so that NumPy core knows
 * nothing about this going on.
 * The slight difficulty here is that `context` metadata needs to be mutated.
 * It also adds a tiny bit of overhead, since we have to "fix" the descriptors
 * and unpack the auxdata.
 *
 * This means that this currently needs to live within NumPy, as it needs both
 * extensive API exposure to do it outside, as well as some thoughts on how to
 * expose the `context` without breaking ABI forward compatibility.
 * (I.e. we probably need to allocate the context and provide a copy function
 * or so.)

 * Wraps the original identity function, needs to translate the descriptors
 * back to the original ones and provide an "original" context (identically to
 * `get_loop`).
 * We assume again that translating the descriptors is quick.

 * Allows creating of a fairly lightweight wrapper around an existing ufunc

 * in that it enforces that you cannot use a loop from another ufunc.
