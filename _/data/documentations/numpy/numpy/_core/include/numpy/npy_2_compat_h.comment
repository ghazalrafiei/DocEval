 * This header file defines relevant features which:
 * - Require runtime inspection depending on the NumPy version.
 * - May be needed when compiling with an older version of NumPy to allow
 *   a smooth transition.
 *
 * As such, it is shipped with NumPy 2.0, but designed to be vendored in full
 * or parts by downstream projects.
 *
 * It must be included after any other includes.  `import_array()` must have
 * been called in the scope or version dependency will misbehave, even when
 * only `PyUFunc_` API is used.
 *
 * If required complicated defs (with inline functions) should be written as:
 *
 *     #if NPY_FEATURE_VERSION >= NPY_2_0_API_VERSION
 *         Simple definition when NumPy 2.0 API is guaranteed.
 *     #else
 *         static inline definition of a 1.x compatibility shim
 *         #if NPY_ABI_VERSION < 0x02000000
 *            Make 1.x compatibility shim the public API (1.x only branch)
 *         #else
 *             Runtime dispatched version (1.x or 2.x)
 *         #endif
 *     #endif
 *
 * An internal build always passes NPY_FEATURE_VERSION >= NPY_2_0_API_VERSION

 * Allow users to use `PyArray_RUNTIME_VERSION` when vendoring the file for
 * compilation with NumPy 1.x.
 * Simply do not define when compiling with 2.x.  It must be defined later
 * as it is set during `import_array()`.
 ','line_number':33,'multiline':True]['text':'
   * If we are compiling with NumPy 1.x, PyArray_RUNTIME_VERSION so we
   * pretend the `PyArray_RUNTIME_VERSION` is `NPY_FEATURE_VERSION`.

 * New macros for accessing real and complex part of a complex number can be
 * found in "npy_2_complexcompat.h".
 ','line_number':47,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * NPY_DEFAULT_INT
 *
 * The default integer has changed, `NPY_DEFAULT_INT` is available at runtime
 * for use as type number, e.g. `PyArray_DescrFromType(NPY_DEFAULT_INT)`.
