	 * Will fork a new process with the provided module identifier in a utility
	 * process and establishes a message port connection to that process. The other
	 * end of the message port connection will be sent back to the calling window
	 * as identified by the `reply` configuration.
	 *
	 * Requires the forked process to be AMD module that uses our IPC channel framework
	 * to respond to the provided `channelName` as a server.
	 *
	 * The process will be automatically terminated when the receiver window closes,
	 * crashes or loads/reloads. It can also explicitly be terminated by calling
	 * `disposeWorker`.
	 *
	 * Note on affinity: repeated calls to `createWorker` with the same `moduleId` from
	 * the same window will result in any previous forked process to get terminated.
	 * In other words, it is not possible, nor intended to create multiple workers of
	 * the same process from one window. The intent of these workers is to be reused per
	 * window and the communication channel allows to dynamically update the processes
	 * after the fact.
	 *
	 * @returns a promise that resolves then the worker terminated. Provides more details
	 * about the termination that can be used to figure out if the termination was unexpected
	 * or not and whether the worker needs to be restarted.
