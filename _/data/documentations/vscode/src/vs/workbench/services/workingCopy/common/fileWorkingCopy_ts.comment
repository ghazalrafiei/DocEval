	 * This event signals ANY changes to the contents, for example:
	 * - through the user typing into the editor
	 * - from API usage (e.g. bulk edits)
	 * - when `IFileWorkingCopyModel#update` is invoked with contents
	 *   that are different from the current contents
	 *
	 * The file working copy will listen to these changes and may mark
	 * the working copy as dirty whenever this event fires.

	 * Note: ONLY report changes to the model but not the underlying
	 * file. The file working copy is tracking changes to the file
	 * automatically.
