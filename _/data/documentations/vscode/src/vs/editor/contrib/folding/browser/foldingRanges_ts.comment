	 * Two inputs, each a FoldingRegions or a FoldRange[], are merged.
	 * Each input must be pre-sorted on startLineNumber.
	 * The first list is assumed to always include all regions currently defined by range providers.
	 * The second list only contains the previously collapsed and all manual ranges.
	 * If the line position matches, the range of the new range is taken, and the range is no longer manual
	 * When an entry in one list overlaps an entry in the other, the second list's entry "wins" and
	 * overlapping entries in the first list are discarded.
	 * Invalid entries are discarded. An entry is invalid if:
	 * 		the start and end line numbers aren't a valid range of line numbers,
	 * 		it is out of sequence or has the same start line as a preceding entry,
	 * 		it overlaps a preceding entry and is not fully contained by that entry.
