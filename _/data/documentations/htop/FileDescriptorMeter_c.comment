    * As the plain total value can be very large compared to
    * the actually used value, this is capped in the following way:
    *
    * 1. If the maximum value is below (or equal to) 1<<16, use it directly
    * 2. If the maximum value is above, use powers of 2 starting at 1<<16 and
    *    double it until it's larger than 16 times the used file handles
    *    (capped at the maximum number of files)
    * 3. If the maximum is effectively unlimited (AKA > 1<<30),
    *    Do the same as for 2, but cap at 1<<30.
