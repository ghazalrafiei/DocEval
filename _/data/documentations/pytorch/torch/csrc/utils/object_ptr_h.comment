 * An RAII-style, owning pointer to a PyObject.  You must protect
 * destruction of this object with the GIL.
 *
 * WARNING: Think twice before putting this as a field in a C++
 * struct.  This class does NOT take out the GIL on destruction,
 * so if you will need to ensure that the destructor of your struct
 * is either (a) always invoked when the GIL is taken or (b) takes
 * out the GIL itself.  Easiest way to avoid this problem is to
 * not use THPPointer in this situation.
