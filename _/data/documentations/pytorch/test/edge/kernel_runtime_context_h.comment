 * Bucket type abstraction that contains many elements of runtime state that
 * a kernel author may want available, but would otherwise be unable to access.
 *
 * Forwarded along to all operators when running in lean mode. NOTE: Will not be
 * forwarded to operators if running in ATen mode as those operators do not
 * expect to receive a KernelRuntimeContext and would not use it.
 *
 * This includes things like setting an error state, a scratch allocator for
 * operators that need more then constant space, and a TensorResizer for dynamic
 * shape tensors allowing programs to be more flexible with Tensor shape.

   * Construct a new kernel runtime context along with an optional event tracer.

   * Returns a pointer to an instance of EventTracer to do profiling/debugging
   * logging inside the codegen layer. This is only for internal usage inside
   * the codegen layer and users should not be accessing this.
