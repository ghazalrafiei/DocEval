     * Convert int32_t input to FP32 and multiply by FP32 scale.
     * Both operations involve roundings:
     * - Large int32_t values can't be exactly represented as FP32. We expect
     * that conversion instruction would round it to nearest FP32 value with
     * ties to even, but Clang documentation for __builtin_convertvector does
     *   not guarantee that.
     * - Product of two FP32 values is generally not exactly representation as
     * an FP32 value, and will be rounded to nearest FP32 value with ties to
     * even.

     * Clang/gcc vector extension does not provide an intrinsics for a
     * floating-point to integer conversion operation with
     * rounding-to-nearest-even. In lieu of such intrinsic, we use a magic trick
     * of adding a large number (1.5 * 2**23) to scaled value to cause rounding
     * to integer, and then substracing this magic number as integer. This trick
     * works only in a limited range (absolute value of input must be less than
     * 2**22), so generally we have to clamp input to this range before using
     * the magic. However, clamping to any smaller range works just as well, and
     * thus we clamp to [qmin - zero point, qmax - zero point] range so that
     * after we add zero point to the result, it gets into target [qmin, qmax]
     * range.

     * Select low 8 bits of each 32-bit integer in the vectors for the output.
     * Since result is already clamped to [qmin, qmax] subrange of [0, 255],
     * saturation is not needed.
