* CUDAEvents are movable not copyable wrappers around CUDA's events.
*
* CUDAEvents are constructed lazily when first recorded unless it is
* reconstructed from a cudaIpcEventHandle_t. The event has a device, and this
* device is acquired from the first recording stream. However, if reconstructed
* from a handle, the device should be explicitly specified; or if ipc_handle() is
* called before the event is ever recorded, it will use the current device.
* Later streams that record the event must match this device.
