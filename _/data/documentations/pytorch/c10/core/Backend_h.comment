 * This legacy enum class defines the set of backends supported by old school,
 * code generated Type-based ATen.  A "backend" in this sense roughly
 * corresponds to the cartesian product of (device type, layout), but restricted
 * only to combinations which we actually have kernels for.  Backend does NOT
 * include dtype.
 *
 * The reason we are sunsetting this enum class is because it doesn't allow for
 * open registration; e.g., if you want to add SparseXLA, you'd have to
 * edit this enum; you wouldn't be able to do it out of tree.  DispatchKey is
 * the replacement for Backend which supports open registration.
 *
 * NB: The concept of 'Backend' here disagrees with the notion of backend
 * exposed to users in torch.backends.  Backend here is something like "CPU"
 * or "SparseCUDA"; backend in torch.backends is something like "MKL" or
 * "CUDNN".
