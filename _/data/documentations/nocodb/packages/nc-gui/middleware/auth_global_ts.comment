 * Global auth middleware
 *
 * On page transitions, this middleware checks if the target route requires authentication.
 * If the user is not signed in, the user is redirected to the sign in page.
 * If the user is signed in and attempts to access a route that does not require authentication (i.e. signin/signup pages),
 * the user is redirected to the home page.
 *
 * By default, we assume that auth is required
 * If not required, mark the page as requiresAuth: false
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * definePageMeta({
 *   requiresAuth: false
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * If auth should be circumvented completely mark the page as public
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * definePageMeta({
 *   public: true
 * })
 * ```
