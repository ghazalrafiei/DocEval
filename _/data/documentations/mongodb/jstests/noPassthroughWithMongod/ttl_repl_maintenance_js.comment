 * This tests ensures that when a stand-alone server is started with something in
 *  local.system.replset, it doesn't start the TTL monitor (SERVER-6609). The test creates a
 *  dummy replset config & TTL collection, then restarts the member and ensures that it doesn't
 *  time out the docs in the TTL collection. Then it removes the "config" and
 *  restarts, ensuring that the TTL monitor deletes the docs.
