 * This test attempts to reproduce the bug described in SERVER-48002. This is a best-effort test
 * that will not detect this bug on every run, even if a bug exists.
 *
 * Snapshot isolation cannot be guaranteed for operations that ignore prepare conflicts.
 * This means that two reads of the same record in the same snapshot can return different results.
 * In practice, the DataCorruptionDetected assertion added by SERVER-40620 will trigger if an index
 * points to a non-existent record.
 *
 * Queries that ignore prepare conflicts and use an index to satisfy a read can read a key from an
 * index and fetch a record that appears to go missing within the same snapshot. This may happen
 * when the collection read races with a prepared transaction that commits and deletes the record.
