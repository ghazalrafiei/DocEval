['text':' SERVER-56756 Ensure that during a stepDown operation we fassert when
 * getting the RSTL takes longer than fassertOnLockTimeoutForStepUpDown seconds
 *
 * 1. Start up a 3 node replica set
 * 2. Enable failpoint hangWithLockDuringBatchInsert
 * 3. Do one write in the background which, due to the failpoint, will hang
 *    after getting locks including RSTL
 * 4. Send in the background request to the PRIMARY to StepDown.
 *    stepDown thread will timeout since it cant get RSTL, and will catch
 *    ErrorCodes::LockTimeout and caus an fassert (node crash) on the primary
 *    [since deadline is beyond the RSTL fassert timeout].
 * 5. Make sure that primary node is down and that another has stepedUp
