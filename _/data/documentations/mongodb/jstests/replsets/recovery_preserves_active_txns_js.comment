 * When the oplog size grows during recovery to exceed the configured maximum, the node must
 * truncate the oplog only up to the oldest active transaction timestamp at the time of the last
 * stable checkpoint. The first oplog entry that belongs to an active transaction is preserved, and
 * all entries after it.
 *
 * This tests the oldestActiveTransactionTimestamp, which is calculated from the "startOpTime"
 * field of documents in the config.transactions collection.
