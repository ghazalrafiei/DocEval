 * This test resyncs a majority member against a minority node, so that it no longer has
 * a write it originally helped commit. It then switches primaries and begins a new branch
 * of history, so that same write is now in the minority. The only remaining member to still
 * have that write is forced to (try to) roll back, and it crashes as it refuses to roll back
 * majority-committed writes.
