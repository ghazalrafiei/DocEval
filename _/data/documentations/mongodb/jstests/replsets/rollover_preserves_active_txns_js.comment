 * When a primary's oplog size exceeds the configured maximum, it must truncate the oplog only up to
 * the oldest active transaction timestamp at the time of the last stable checkpoint. The first
 * oplog entry that belongs to an active transaction is preserved, and all entries after it.
 *
 * This tests the oldestActiveTransactionTimestamp, which is calculated from the "startOpTime"
 * field of documents in the config.transactions collection.
