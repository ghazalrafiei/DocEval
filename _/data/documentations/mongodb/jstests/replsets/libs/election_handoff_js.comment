     * Exercises and validates an election handoff scenario by stepping down the primary and
     * ensuring that the node at "expectedCandidateId" is stepped up in its place. The desired
     * configuration of the replica set is passed in as its ReplSetTest instance.
     *
     * The options parameter contains extra options for the handoff.  Currently supported options
     * are:
     *   stepDownBySignal - When this option is set, the primary will be stepped down by stopping
     *                      and restarting with sigterm, rather than with a replSetStepDown command
     *   stepDownPeriodSecs - The number of seconds to step down the primary.
     *   secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs - The number of seconds that the mongod will wait for an
     *                                electable secondary to catch up to the primary.
