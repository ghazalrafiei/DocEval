 * Test a nested $or query which reproduces SERVER-84013, a bug in the subplanner. This bug had to
 * do with the subplanner assuming that multiple invocations of MatchExpression::optimize() yielded
 * the same expressions, which turns out not to be the case. The queries in this regression test
 * excerise the $or -> $in rewrite which produce new $in expressions which themselves could be
 * further optimized.
