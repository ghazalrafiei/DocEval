['text':'*
 * Utilities for testing TTL collections.
 ','line_number':1,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Wait until documents inserted before a call to this function have been visited by a TTL
     * monitor pass. On replica sets, by default the function waits for the TTL deletes to become
     * visible with read concern 'majority'.
     *
     * @param {DB} db   Database connection.
     * @param {boolean} waitForMajorityCommit   Only applies when 'db' is from a replica set, set to
     *     false to disable waiting for TTL deletes to become majority commited.
     * @param {number} timeoutMillis   timeout in milliseconds for the TTL wait. Defaults to
     *     whatever value is used for assert.soon.
