 * This override checks the result of runCommand to see if an OperationNotSupportedInTransaction,
 * InvalidOptions or TransientTransactionError was returned. Some FSM workloads don't check if
 * runCommand worked because it is expected to fail when certain other operations are running. We
 * want to make sure that those errors are still ignored but not OperationNotSupportedInTransaction,
 * InvalidOptions or TransientTransactionError.
