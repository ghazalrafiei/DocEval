     * which was chosen as the merger and what pipeline is used to merge.
     * - 'expectedShard' and 'expectedShardStages' allow for assertions around targeting a single
     * shard for execution.
     * - 'assertSBELookupPushdown' asserts that $lookup was pushed down into SBE when present.

     * Function to set up a collection in 'db':
     * - 'collName' specifies the name of the collection.
     * - 'indexList' specifies a list of indexes to build on the collection.
     * - 'docs' specifies a set of documents to insert.
     * - 'collType' specifies the type of collection (i.e. "sharded" or "unsplittable").
     * - 'shardKey' and 'chunkList' are used to configure a sharded collection.
     * - 'owningShard' designates the shard that an unsplittable collection should live on.

     * Function which runs 'pipeline' using the explain and aggregate commands to verify correct
     * results and expected shard targeting behavior.
     * - 'targetCollName' names the collection to target 'pipeline' with.
     * - 'explainAssertionObj' describes assertions to be made against the explain output (see
     *   'assertExplainTargeting' for more detail).
     * - 'expectedResults' contains the output that running 'pipeline' should produce.
     * - 'comment' is a string that will allow 'pipeline' (and, in some cases, sub-queries) to be
     *    uniquely identified in profiler output.
     * - 'profileFilters' is a map from shard name to objects containing arguments to create a
     * filter to query the profiler output.
