 * Set internalQueryFrameworkControl to tryBonsaiExperimental and
 * internalQueryCardinalityEstimatorMode to sampling. This is intended to be used by tasks which
 * should use experimental bonsai behavior, currently defined by both the control knob and the CE
 * mode, regardless of the configuration of the variant running the task. This is needed because the
 * suite definition cannot override a knob which is also defined by the variant.
