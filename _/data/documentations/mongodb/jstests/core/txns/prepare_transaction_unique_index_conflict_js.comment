 * Test that doing an insert on a collection with a unique index causes a prepare conflict if that
 * collection has operations from a prepared transaction on it. To make sure that the new document
 * doesn't violate the unique index, the node will have to perform reads on documents in the
 * collection. Since there are prepared operations on documents in the collection, the read should
 * cause a prepare conflict.
