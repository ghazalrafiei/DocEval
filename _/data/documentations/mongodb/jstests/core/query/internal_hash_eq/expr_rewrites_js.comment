 * Tests that $expr with equality of $toHashedIndexKey to a NumberLong results in an IXSCAN plan

 * Helper function to get the index hash of given field in the row matching the given filterSpec.
 * @param {Collection} coll
 * @param {Object} filterSpec - Object representing an equality predicate. Expected to uniquely
 *     identify a single document.
 * @param {String} field - Name of the field which has a hashed index defined.
 * @param {Object} indexSpec - Object representing the index specification. Must have field as a
 *     hashed index.

 * Given the explain output of a plan, assert that the plan used an index scan, the given index and
 * the number of keys examined.
 * @param {Object} explainPlan - Output of explain run with 'executionStats'.
 * @param {Object} expectedIndexSpec - The expected key pattern of the index scan.
 * @param {int} expectedKeysExamined - The expected number of keys in the index that were examined.
