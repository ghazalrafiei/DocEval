 * This test tests concurrent read and write behavior for tailable cursors on unreplicated capped
 * collections. These collections accept concurrent writes and thus must ensure no documents are
 * skipped for forward cursors.
 *
 * This test sets up a single capped collection with many concurrent writers. Concurrent readers
 * open tailable cursors and clone the contents into their own collection copies. The readers then
 * assert that the contents match the source.
