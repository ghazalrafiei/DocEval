 * Tests exhaustion of read tickets, trying to force a deadlock reproduction
 * after yield restores lock state. See SERVER-75205 for more information.
 *
 * Deadlock:
 * The deadlock in question involves readers acquiring the RSTL lock, which no longer
 * happens in 5.0+ due to lock-free reads. Therefore, this test doesn't exercise the
 * deadlock behavior on 5.0+. 4.4 is the primary target of this test, but there isn't
 * much test coverage of ticket exhaustion, so this test may provide other benefits on
 * 5.0+.
 *
 * Parallel Shell Coordination:
 * The 'jsTestName().timing_coordination' collection is used to coordinate timing
 * between the main thread of the test and all the readers via writes to specific
 * documents. One side will wait until the document appears.
 *
 * Two types of Parallel Shells:
 * There are two sets of readers - queued and new - meant to saturate the ticketing
 * system before and after the sleep operation that holds the global X lock. This
 * dual system of readers ensures that enqueued/blocked readers as well as newly
 * arriving reads are serviced without deadlocking.
 * queuedLongReadsFunc - Issues long read commands until told to stop.
 *    newLongReadsFunc - When told to begin, issues long read commands until told
 *                       to stop.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 * 0) Start ReplSet with special params:
 *     - lower read ticket concurrency
 *     - increase yielding
 * 1) Insert 1000 documents.
 * 2) Kick off parallel readers that perform long collection scans, subject to yields.
 * 3) Sleep with global X Lock (including RSTL), thus queuing up reads.
 * 4) Signal new readers that will be received after the global lock is released.
 * 5) Initiate step down while queue is working its way down to ensure there is a mix of
 *     enqueued readers from the global X lock and new readers initiated afterwards.
 * <<Should have deadlocked by now for this scenario>>
 * 6) Stop Readers.
