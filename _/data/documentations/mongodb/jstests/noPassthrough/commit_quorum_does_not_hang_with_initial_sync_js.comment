 * Initial syncing a node with two phase index builds should immediately build all ready indexes
 * from the sync source and only setup the index builder threads for any unfinished index builds
 * grouped by their buildUUID.
 *
 * Previously, an initial syncing node would start and finish the index build when it applied the
 * "commitIndexBuild" oplog entry, but the primary will no longer send that oplog entry until the
 * commit quorum is satisfied, which may depend on the initial syncing nodes vote.
 *
 * Take into consideration the following scenario where the primary could not achieve the commit
 * quorum without the initial syncing nodes vote:
 * 1. Node A (primary) starts a two-phase index build "x_1" with commit quorum "votingMembers".
 * 2. Node B (secondary) shuts down while building the "x_1" index, preventing the node from sending
 *    its vote to the primary.
 * 3. Node A cannot achieve the commit quorum and is stuck. The "commitIndexBuild" oplog entry does
 *    not get sent to any other nodes.
