 * Tests that resumable index build state is written to disk upon clean shutdown when an index
 * build is in the drain writes phase on a secondary, and that the index build is subsequently
 * completed when the node is started back up.
 *
 * For this test, the secondary is ineligible to become primary, but still has a vote so it is
 * required for the commit quorum to be satisfied.
