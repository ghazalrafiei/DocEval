 * Test to check that the RSM receives a hello reply "immediately" (or "quickly") after a RS
 * topology change when using the exhaust protocol. In order to test this, we'll set the
 * maxAwaitTimeMS to much higher than the default (5 mins). This will allow us to assert that the
 * RSM receives the hello replies because of a topology change rather than maxAwaitTimeMS being
 * hit. A replica set node should send a response to the mongos as soon as it processes a topology
 * change, so "immediately"/"quickly" can vary - we specify 5 seconds in this test ('timeoutMS').
