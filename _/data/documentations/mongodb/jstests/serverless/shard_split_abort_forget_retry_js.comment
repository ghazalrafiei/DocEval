 * Starts a shard split operation that aborts, either due to the
 * abortShardSplitBeforeLeavingBlockingState failpoint or due to receiving abortShardSplit,
 * and then issues a forgetShardSplit command. Finally, starts a second shard split operation with
 * the same tenantIds as the aborted shard split, and expects this second one to go through.
