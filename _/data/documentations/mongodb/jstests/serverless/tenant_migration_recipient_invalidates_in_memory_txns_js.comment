 * Tests that tenant migrations will invalid transactions that are stored in-memory when fetching
 * committed transactions from the donor. We do this by first running a transaction with txnNum 0 on
 * the donor and migrating it to the recipient. After the migration commits, we then run a read-only
 * transaction on the recipient. We expect the read-only transaction to only advance the in-memory
 * state of the transaction -- it should not update the 'config.transaction' entry on the recipient.
 * Then, we run a second migration. By this point, the recipient has an in-memory transaction number
 * of 1 for the session, which is ahead of the donor. However, the migration should still complete,
 * because the recipient will invalidate its in-memory understanding and refetch the on-disk
 * transaction state instead.
 *
 * Note: incompatible_with_shard_merge because (1) this test runs back-to-back migrations, and
 * (2) because of the two-phase nature of the database drop between migrations, wt files will
 * still be present on the recipient during the second migration, leading to errors.
