 * Tests that the recipient will retry a migration on donor sync source failure in the following
 * scenarios:
 * - donor shuts down when the recipient oplog fetcher is created but cloning has yet to start
 * - donor shuts down in the middle of the cloning phase
 * - donor shuts down after cloning is finished but the recipient has yet to declare that the data
 *   is consistent
 *
 * Incompatible with shard merge, which can't handle restart.
