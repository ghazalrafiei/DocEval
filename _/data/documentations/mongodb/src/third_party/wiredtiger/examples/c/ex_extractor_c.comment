 *	Example of how to use a WiredTiger custom index extractor extension.
 ','line_number':1,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * Number of years this data spans
 ','line_number':46,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * A custom index extractor function that adds an index entry for each year of the given president's
 * term.
 ','line_number':52,'multiline':True]['text':' Unused parameters ','line_number':63,'multiline':True]['text':' Unpack the value. ','line_number':67,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * We have overlapping years, so multiple records may share the same index key.
     ','line_number':71,'multiline':True]['text':'
         * Note that the extract callback is called for all operations that update the table, not
         * just inserts. The user sets the key and uses the cursor->insert() method to return the
         * index key(s). WiredTiger will perform the required operation (such as a remove()).
         ','line_number':75,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * The terminate method is called to release any allocated resources when the table is closed. In
 * this example, no cleanup is required.
 ','line_number':88,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * Read the index by year and print out who was in office that year.
 ','line_number':108,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * Pick 10 random years and read the data.
     ','line_number':123,'multiline':True]['text':' Report all presidents that served during the chosen year ','line_number':134,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * Remove some items from the primary table.
 ','line_number':149,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * Removing items from the primary table will call the extractor for the index and allow our
     * custom extractor code to handle each custom key.
     ','line_number':159,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * Just remove the first few items.
     ','line_number':164,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * Set up the table and index of the data.
 ','line_number':174,'multiline':True]['text':' Create the primary table. It has a key of the unique ID. ','line_number':184,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * Create the index that is generated with an extractor. The index will generate an entry in the
     * index for each year a president was in office.
