 * The timestamp monitor class manages global timestamp state for all components in the test
 * harness. It also manages the global timestamps within WiredTiger.
 *
 * The format of a timestamp is as follows, the first 32 bits represent the epoch time in seconds.
 * The last 32 bits represent an increment for uniqueness.

     * Generate a timestamp between the oldest timestamp and the stable timestamp.

     * WiredTiger will abort commit transactions that attempt to commit behind an active read
     * timestamp in order to preserve repeatable reads. Currently the cppsuite doesn't handle that
     * well, so to avoid this issue we will read behind the stable timestamp.
     *
     * This timestamp isn't guaranteed to provide a repeatable read as the oldest could move
     * concurrently removing the previously seen data.
