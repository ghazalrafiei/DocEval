 * Here we want to age out entire pages, i.e. the stop time pair on a page should be globally
 * visible. To do so we'll update ranges of keys with increasing timestamps which will age out the

 * getting cleaned up from the history store.
 *
 * This is then tracked using the associated statistic which can be found in the metrics_monitor.
