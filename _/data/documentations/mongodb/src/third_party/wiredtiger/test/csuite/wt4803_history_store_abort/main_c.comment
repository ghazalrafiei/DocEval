 * JIRA ticket reference: WT-4803 Test case description: This test is checking the functionality of

 * value, we expect to panic. Failure mode: If we receive a panic in the test cases we weren't
 * expecting to and vice versa.

 * This is a global flag that should be set before running test_hs_workload. It lets the child
 * process know whether it should be expecting a panic or not so that it can adjust its exit code as
