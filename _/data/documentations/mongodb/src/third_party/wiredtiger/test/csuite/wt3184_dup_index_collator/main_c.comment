 * JIRA ticket reference: WT-3184 Test case description: Each set of data is ordered and contains
 * five elements (0-4). We insert elements 1 and 3, and then do search_near and search for each
 * element. For each set of data, we perform these tests first using a custom collator, and second
 * using a custom collator and extractor. In each case there are index keys having variable length.
 * Failure mode: In the reported test case, the custom compare routine is given a truncated key to
 * compare, and the unpack functions return errors because the truncation appeared in the middle of
 * a key.
