 * JIRA ticket reference: WT-2323
 *
 * Test case description: We create two kinds of threads that race: One kind
 * is populating/updating records in a table with a few indices, the other
 * is reading from a join of that table. The hope in constructing this test
 * was to have the updates interleaved between reads of multiple indices by
 * the join, yielding an inconsistent view of the data.  In the main table,
 * we insert account records, with a positive or negative balance.  The
 * negative balance accounts always have a flag set to non-zero, positive
 * balances have the flag set to zero.  The join we do is:
 *
 *   select (*) from account where account.postal_code = '54321' and
 *                      account.balance < 0 and account.flags == 0
 *
 * which should always yield no results.
 *
 * Failure mode: This test never actually failed with any combination of
 * parameters, with N_INSERT up to 50000000.  It seems that a snapshot is
 * implicitly allocated in the session used by a join by the set_key calls
 * that occur before the first 'next' of the join cursor is done.  Despite
 * that, the test seems interesting enough to keep around, with the number
 * of inserts set low as a default.
