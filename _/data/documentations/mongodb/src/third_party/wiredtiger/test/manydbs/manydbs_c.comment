 * Maximum expected condition variable wakeups. POSIX allows arbitrarily many spurious wakeups to
 * happen, so we need to be able to adjust this expectation per-platform. There are two cases: when
 * completely idle, and when running a light workload. The latter is expressed as a fraction of the
 * total number of condition variable sleeps; the former is a constant.

 * NetBSD should never generate spurious wakeups, but does: see https://gnats.netbsd.org/56275.
 * Windows can also generate spurious wakeups:

 * test to complete in spite of that. MacOS can run more slowly which limits writes being coalesced
 * for the log causing more resets.
