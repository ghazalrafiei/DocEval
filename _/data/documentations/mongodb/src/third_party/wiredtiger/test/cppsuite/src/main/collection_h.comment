     * Adding new keys should generally be singly threaded per collection. If two threads both
     * attempt to add keys using the incrementing id pattern they'd frequently conflict.
     *
     * The usage pattern is:
     *   1. Call get_key_count to get the number of keys already existing. Add keys with id's equal
     *      to and greater than this value.
     *   2. Once the transaction has successfully committed then call increase_key_count() with the
     *      number of added keys.
     *
     * The set of keys should always be contiguous such that other threads calling get_key_count
     * will always know that the keys in existence are 0 -> _key_count - 1.
