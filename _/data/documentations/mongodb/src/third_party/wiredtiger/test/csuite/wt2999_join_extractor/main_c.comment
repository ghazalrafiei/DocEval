 * Test case description: Create a table that stores ~4K size blobs; two indices are defined using a
 * pair of custom extractors that pull the first and second 32-bit integers from the blob. A simple
 * join is created using the two indices, and iterated.
 *
 * Failure mode: When a custom extractor is used with cursor joins, there are memory leaks at the
 * point where the extractor sets the key.
