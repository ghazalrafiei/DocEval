 * The hardware-accelerated checksum code that originally shipped on Windows did not correctly
 * handle memory that wasn't 8B aligned and a multiple of 8B. It's likely that calculations were
 * always 8B aligned, but there's some risk.
 *
 * What we do is always write the correct checksum, and if a checksum test fails, check it against
 * the alternate version have before failing.
