 * GCC __builtin_pack_vector_int128 returns a vector __int128_t but Clang does not recognize this
 * type. On GCC this builtin is translated to a xxpermdi instruction that only moves the registers
 * __a, __b instead generates a load.
 *
 * Clang has vec_xxpermdi intrinsics. It was implemented in 4.0.0.

 * Clang 7 changed the behavior of vec_xxpermdi in order to provide the same behavior of GCC. That
 * means code adapted to Clang >= 7 does not work on Clang <= 6. So, fallback to
 * __builtin_unpack_vector() on Clang <= 6.
