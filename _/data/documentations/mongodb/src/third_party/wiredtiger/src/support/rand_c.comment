 * An implementation of George Marsaglia's multiply-with-carry pseudo-random number generator.
 * Computationally fast, with reasonable randomness properties, and a claimed period of > 2^60.
 *
 * Be very careful about races here. Multiple threads can call __wt_random concurrently, and it is
 * okay if those concurrent calls get the same return value. What is *not* okay is if
 * reading/writing the shared state races and uses two different values for m_w or m_z. That can
 * result in a stored value of zero, in which case they will be stuck on zero forever. Take a local
 * copy of the values to avoid that, and read/write in atomic, 8B chunks.
 *
 * Please do not modify the behavior of __wt_random when it is used with the default seed. We have
 * verified that it produces good-quality randomness for our uses within the WiredTiger library, so
 * we would like to preserve its current behavior.

     * XOR the provided seed with the initial seed. With high probability, this would provide a
     * random-looking seed which has about 50% of the bits turned on. We don't need to check whether
     * W or Z becomes 0, because we would handle it the first time we use this state to generate a
     * random number.

     * Use this, instead of __wt_random_init, to vary the initial state of the RNG. This is
     * (currently) only used by test programs, where, for example, an initial set of test data is
     * created by a single thread, and we want more variability in the initial state of the RNG.
     *
     * Take the seconds and nanoseconds from the clock together with the thread ID to generate a
     * 64-bit seed, then smear that value using algorithm "xor" from Marsaglia, "Xorshift RNGs".

     * Generally, every thread should have their own RNG state, but it's not guaranteed. Take a copy
     * of the random state so we can ensure that the calculation operates on the state consistently
     * regardless of concurrent calls with the same random state.
     ','line_number':143,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * Check if either of the two values goes to 0 (from which we won't recover), and reset it to
     * the default initial state. This would never happen with the default seed, but we need this
     * for the other cases.
     *
     * We do this one component at a time, so that if the random number generator was initialized
     * from an explicitly provided seed, it would not reset the entire state and then effectively
     * result in random number generators from different seeds converging. They would eventually
     * converge if both W and Z become 0 at the same time, but this is very unlikely.
     *
     * This has additional benefits if a caller fails to initialize the state, or initializes with a
     * seed that results in a short period.
