 * WiredTiger uses opaque pointers to expose only necessary data to end users. This public
 * information is stored in the iface field at the beginning of the struct, and private fields can
 * be accessed by casting the pointer to our internal type. Since this is just type casting and
 * pointer arithmetic the public fields must be the first fields in the struct.

 * WT_UPDATE is special: we arrange fields to avoid padding within the structure but it could be
 * padded at the end depending on the timestamp size. Further check that the data field in the

 * WT_UPDATE: Validate expected sum of field sizes compared to compiler determined structure size.
 * If the fields WT_UPDATE these assertions should be revised to match the trailing padding of the

 * The btree code encodes key/value pairs in size_t's, and requires at least 8B size_t's.

 * We require a wt_off_t fit into an 8B chunk because 8B is the largest integral value we can encode
 * into an address cookie.

 * WiredTiger has never been tested on a system with 4B file offsets, disallow them for now.

 * We require a time_t be an integral type and fit into a uint64_t for simplicity.
