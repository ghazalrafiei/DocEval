         * Skip queuing pages that are already in cache or are internal. They aren't the pages we

         * that page was evicted and now a future page wants to be pre-fetched, this algorithm needs
         * a tweak. It would need to remember which child was last queued and start again from
         * there, rather than this approximation which assumes recently pre-fetched pages are still
         * in cache. Don't prefetch fast deleted pages to avoid wasted effort. We can skip reading
         * these deleted pages into the cache if the fast truncate information is visible in the
         * session transaction snapshot.
