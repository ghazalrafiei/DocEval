 * Provides the GCP Store with a logger implementation that redirects the generated logs to
 * WiredTiger's logging streams. This class implements GCP's LogBackend class, an interface for
 * logging implementations. Functions are derived from the interface to incorporate the logging with
 * WiredTiger's logging system.

 * GCP's LogSink is used to initialize the log system to the SDK.
