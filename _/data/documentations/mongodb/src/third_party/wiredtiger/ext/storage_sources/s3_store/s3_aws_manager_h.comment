 * The AWS SDK must only be initialized once and must call initialization and shutdown in the
 * correct order. The AwsManager handles multiple calls from the S3 extension initialization and
 * uses a reference counter to check how many instances of the S3 extension are using the SDK. The
 * first call to the extension will initiate the SDK while subsequent calls will increment the
 * reference counter. Then each call to terminate will decrement the reference counter until it
 * reaches 0 at which point SDK shutdown will be called.
