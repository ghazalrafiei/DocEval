 * LZ4 decompression requires the exact compressed byte count returned by the LZ4_compress_default
 * and LZ4_compress_destSize functions. WiredTiger doesn't track that value, store it in the
 * destination buffer.
 *
 * Additionally, LZ4_compress_destSize may compress into the middle of a record, and after
 * decompression we return the length to the last record successfully decompressed, not the number
 * of bytes decompressed; store that value in the destination buffer as well.
 *
 * (Since raw compression has been removed from WiredTiger, the lz4 compression code no longer calls
 * LZ4_compress_destSize. Some support remains to support existing compressed objects.)
 *
 * Use fixed-size, 4B values (WiredTiger never writes buffers larger than 4GB).
 *
 * The unused field is available for a mode flag if one is needed in the future, we guarantee it's
 * 0.

     * Two code paths, one with and one without a bounce buffer. When doing raw compression, we
     * compress to a target size irrespective of row boundaries, and return to our caller a "useful"
     * compression length based on the last complete row that was compressed. Our caller stores that
     * length, not the length of bytes actually compressed by LZ4. In other words, our caller
     * doesn't know how many bytes will result from decompression, likely hasn't provided us a large
     * enough buffer, and we have to allocate a scratch buffer.
