     * All indices using this collator have an integer key, and the primary key is also an integer.
     * A collator is usually passed the concatenation of index key and primary key (when available),
     * hence we initially unpack using "ii".
     *
     * A collator may also be called with an item that includes a index key and no primary key.
     * Among items having the same index key, an item with no primary key should sort before an item
     * with a primary key. The reason is that if the application calls WT_CURSOR::search on a index
     * key for which there are more than one value, the search key will not yet have a primary key.
     * We want to position the cursor at the 'first' matching index key so that repeated calls to
     * WT_CURSOR::next will see them all.
     *
     * To keep this code simple, we do not reverse the ordering when comparing primary keys.
