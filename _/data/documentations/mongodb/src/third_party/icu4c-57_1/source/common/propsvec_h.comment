 * Unicode Properties Vectors associated with code point ranges.
 *
 * Rows of uint32_t integers in a contiguous array store
 * the range limits and the properties vectors.
 *
 * Logically, each row has a certain number of uint32_t values,
 * which is set via the upvec_open() "columns" parameter.
 *
 * Internally, two additional columns are stored.
 * In each internal row,
 * row[0] contains the start code point and
 * row[1] contains the limit code point,
 * which is the start of the next range.
 *
 * Initially, there is only one "normal" row for
 * range [0..0x110000[ with values 0.
 * There are additional rows for special purposes, see UPVEC_FIRST_SPECIAL_CP.
 *
 * It would be possible to store only one range boundary per row,
 * but self-contained rows allow to later sort them by contents.

 * Special pseudo code points for storing the initialValue and the errorValue,
 * which are used to initialize a UTrie2 or similar.
 ','line_number':53,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * Special pseudo code point used in upvec_compact() signalling the end of
 * delivering special values and the beginning of delivering real ones.
 * Stable value, unlike UPVEC_MAX_CP which might grow over time.

 * Open a UPropsVectors object.
 * @param columns Number of value integers (uint32_t) per row.

 * In rows for code points [start..end], select the column,
 * reset the mask bits and set the value bits (ANDed with the mask).

 * Will set U_NO_WRITE_PERMISSION if called after upvec_compact().

 * Logically const but must not be used on the same pv concurrently!

 * pRangeStart and pRangeEnd can be NULL.

 * Compact the vectors:
 * - modify the memory
 * - keep only unique vectors
 * - store them contiguously from the beginning of the memory
 * - for each (non-unique) row, call the handler function
 *
 * The handler's rowIndex is the index of the row in the compacted
 * memory block.
 * (Therefore, it starts at 0 increases in increments of the columns value.)
 *
 * In a first phase, only special values are delivered (each exactly once),
 * with start==end both equalling a special pseudo code point.
 * Then the handler is called once more with start==end==UPVEC_START_REAL_VALUES_CP
 * where rowIndex is the length of the compacted array,
 * and the row is arbitrary (but not NULL).
 * Then, in the second phase, the handler is called for each row of real values.

 * Get the vectors array after calling upvec_compact().
 * The caller must not modify nor release the returned array.
 * Returns NULL if called before upvec_compact().
 ','line_number':135,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * Get a clone of the vectors array after calling upvec_compact().
 * The caller owns the returned array and must uprv_free() it.
 * Returns NULL if called before upvec_compact().
 ','line_number':143,'multiline':True]['text':'
 * Call upvec_compact(), create a 16-bit UTrie2 with indexes into the compacted
 * vectors array, and freeze the trie.
