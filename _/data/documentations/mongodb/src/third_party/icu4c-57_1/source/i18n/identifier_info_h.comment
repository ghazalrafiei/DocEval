 * This class analyzes a possible identifier for script and identifier status. Use it by calling setIdentifierProfile
 * then setIdentifier. Available methods include:
 * <ol>
 * <li>call getScripts for the specific scripts in the identifier. The identifier contains at least one character in
 * each of these.
 * <li>call getAlternates to get cases where a character is not limited to a single script. For example, it could be
 * either Katakana or Hiragana.
 * <li>call getCommonAmongAlternates to find out if any scripts are common to all the alternates.
 * <li>call getNumerics to get a representative character (with value zero) for each of the decimal number systems in
 * the identifier.
 * <li>call getRestrictionLevel to see what the UTS36 restriction level is.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * This is a port from ICU4J of class com.ibm.icu.text.IdentifierInfo

     * Get the set of alternate scripts found in the identifiers. That is, when a character can be in two scripts, then
     * the set consisting of those scripts will be returned.

     * @return a uhash, with each key being of type (ScriptSet *). 
     *         This is a set, not a map, so the value stored in the uhash is not relevant.

     *         Ownership of the uhash and its contents remains with the IndetifierInfo object, 
     *         and remains valid until a new identifer is set or until the object is deleted.

      *   Note: Common and Inherited scripts are omitted from the count.
      *   Note: Result may be high when the identifier contains characters
      *         with alternate scripts. The distinction between
      *         0, 1 and > 1 will remain valid, however.
