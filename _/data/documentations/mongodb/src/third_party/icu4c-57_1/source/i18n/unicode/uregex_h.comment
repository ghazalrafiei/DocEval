 ','line_number':215,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Make a copy of a compiled regular expression.  Cloning a regular
 * expression is faster than opening a second instance from the source
 * form of the expression, and requires less memory.
 * <p>
 * Note that the current input string and the position of any matched text
 *  within it are not cloned; only the pattern itself and the
 *  match mode flags are copied.
 * <p>
 * Cloning can be particularly useful to threaded applications that perform
 * multiple match operations in parallel.  Each concurrent RE
 * operation requires its own instance of a URegularExpression.
 *
 * @param regexp   The compiled regular expression to be cloned.
 * @param status   Receives indication of any errors encountered
 * @return the cloned copy of the compiled regular expression.
 * @stable ICU 3.0
 ','line_number':230,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 *  Returns a pointer to the source form of the pattern for this regular expression.
 *  This function will work even if the pattern was originally specified as a UText.
 *
 * @param regexp     The compiled regular expression.
 * @param patLength  This output parameter will be set to the length of the
 *                   pattern string.  A NULL pointer may be used here if the

 *                   owned by the regular expression object, and must not be
 *                   altered or deleted by the application.  The returned string
 *                   will remain valid until the regular expression is closed.
 * @stable ICU 3.0
 ','line_number':251,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 *  Returns the source text of the pattern for this regular expression.
 *  This function will work even if the pattern was originally specified as a UChar string.
 *

 * @param status     Receives errors detected by this function.
 * @return the pattern text.  The storage for the text is owned by the regular expression

  *  Set the subject text string upon which the regular expression will look for matches.
  *  This function may be called any number of times, allowing the regular
  *  expression pattern to be applied to different strings.
  *  <p>
  *  Regular expression matching operations work directly on the application's
  *  string data.  No copy is made.  The subject string data must not be
  *  altered after calling this function until after all regular expression
  *  operations involving this string data are completed.  
  *  <p>
  *  Zero length strings are permitted.  In this case, no subsequent match
  *  operation will dereference the text string pointer.
  *
  * @param regexp     The compiled regular expression.
  * @param text       The subject text string.
  * @param textLength The length of the subject text, or -1 if the string
  *                   is NUL terminated.
  * @param status     Receives errors detected by this function.
  * @stable ICU 3.0
  ','line_number':301,'multiline':True]['text':'*
  *  Set the subject text string upon which the regular expression will look for matches.
  *  This function may be called any number of times, allowing the regular
  *  expression pattern to be applied to different strings.
  *  <p>
  *  Regular expression matching operations work directly on the application's
  *  string data; only a shallow clone is made.  The subject string data must not be
  *  altered after calling this function until after all regular expression
  *  operations involving this string data are completed.  
  *
  * @param regexp     The compiled regular expression.
  * @param text       The subject text string.
  * @param status     Receives errors detected by this function.
  *
  * @stable ICU 4.6
  ','line_number':328,'multiline':True]['text':'*
  *  Get the subject text that is currently associated with this 
  *   regular expression object.  If the input was supplied using uregex_setText(),
  *   that pointer will be returned.  Otherwise, the characters in the input will
  *   be extracted to a buffer and returned.  In either case, ownership remains
  *   with the regular expression object.
  *
  *  This function will work even if the input was originally specified as a UText.
  *
  * @param regexp      The compiled regular expression.
  * @param textLength  The length of the string is returned in this output parameter. 
  *                    A NULL pointer may be used here if the
  *                    text length is not needed, as would be the case if
  *                    the text is known in advance to be a NUL terminated
  *                    string.
  * @param status      Receives errors detected by this function.

  ','line_number':349,'multiline':True]['text':'*
  *  Get the subject text that is currently associated with this 
  *   regular expression object.
  *
  *  This function will work even if the input was originally specified as a UChar string.
  *
  * @param regexp      The compiled regular expression.
  * @param dest        A mutable UText in which to store the current input.
  *                    If NULL, a new UText will be created as an immutable shallow clone
  *                    of the actual input string.
  * @param status      Receives errors detected by this function.
  * @return            The subject text currently associated with this regular expression.
  *                    If a pre-allocated UText was provided, it will always be used and returned.
  *
  * @stable ICU 4.6
  ','line_number':374,'multiline':True]['text':'*
  *  Set the subject text string upon which the regular expression is looking for matches
  *  without changing any other aspect of the matching state.
  *  The new and previous text strings must have the same content.
  *
  *  This function is intended for use in environments where ICU is operating on 
  *  strings that may move around in memory.  It provides a mechanism for notifying
  *  ICU that the string has been relocated, and providing a new UText to access the
  *  string in its new position.
  *
  *  Note that the regular expression implementation never copies the underlying text
  *  of a string being matched, but always operates directly on the original text 
  *  provided by the user. Refreshing simply drops the references to the old text 
  *  and replaces them with references to the new.
  *
  *  Caution:  this function is normally used only by very specialized
  *            system-level code.   One example use case is with garbage collection 
  *            that moves the text in memory. 
  *
  * @param regexp     The compiled regular expression.
  * @param text       The new (moved) text string.
