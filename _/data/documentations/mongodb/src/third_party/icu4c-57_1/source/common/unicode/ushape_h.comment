 * \brief C API:  Arabic shaping
 * 
 ','line_number':22,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Shape Arabic text on a character basis.
 *
 * <p>This function performs basic operations for "shaping" Arabic text. It is most
 * useful for use with legacy data formats and legacy display technology
 * (simple terminals). All operations are performed on Unicode characters.</p>
 *
 * <p>Text-based shaping means that some character code points in the text are
 * replaced by others depending on the context. It transforms one kind of text
 * into another. In comparison, modern displays for Arabic text select
 * appropriate, context-dependent font glyphs for each text element, which means
 * that they transform text into a glyph vector.</p>
 *
 * <p>Text transformations are necessary when modern display technology is not
 * available or when text needs to be transformed to or from legacy formats that
 * use "shaped" characters. Since the Arabic script is cursive, connecting
 * adjacent letters to each other, computers select images for each letter based
 * on the surrounding letters. This usually results in four images per Arabic
 * letter: initial, middle, final, and isolated forms. In Unicode, on the other
 * hand, letters are normally stored abstract, and a display system is expected
 * to select the necessary glyphs. (This makes searching and other text
 * processing easier because the same letter has only one code.) It is possible
 * to mimic this with text transformations because there are characters in
 * Unicode that are rendered as letters with a specific shape
 * (or cursive connectivity). They were included for interoperability with
 * legacy systems and codepages, and for unsophisticated display systems.</p>
 *
 * <p>A second kind of text transformations is supported for Arabic digits:
 * For compatibility with legacy codepages that only include European digits,
 * it is possible to replace one set of digits by another, changing the
 * character code points. These operations can be performed for either
 * Arabic-Indic Digits (U+0660...U+0669) or Eastern (Extended) Arabic-Indic
 * digits (U+06f0...U+06f9).</p>
 *
 * <p>Some replacements may result in more or fewer characters (code points).
 * By default, this means that the destination buffer may receive text with a
 * length different from the source length. Some legacy systems rely on the
 * length of the text to be constant. They expect extra spaces to be added
 * or consumed either next to the affected character or at the end of the
 * text.</p>
 *
 * <p>For details about the available operations, see the description of the
 * <code>U_SHAPE_...</code> options.</p>
 *
 * @param source The input text.
 *
 * @param sourceLength The number of UChars in <code>source</code>.
 *
 * @param dest The destination buffer that will receive the results of the
 *             requested operations. It may be <code>NULL</code> only if
 *             <code>destSize</code> is 0. The source and destination must not
 *             overlap.
 *
 * @param destSize The size (capacity) of the destination buffer in UChars.
 *                 If <code>destSize</code> is 0, then no output is produced,
 *                 but the necessary buffer size is returned ("preflighting").
 *
 * @param options This is a 32-bit set of flags that specify the operations
 *                that are performed on the input text. If no error occurs,
 *                then the result will always be written to the destination
 *                buffer.
 *
 * @param pErrorCode must be a valid pointer to an error code value,
 *        which must not indicate a failure before the function call.
 *
 * @return The number of UChars written to the destination buffer.
 *         If an error occured, then no output was written, or it may be
 *         incomplete. If <code>U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR</code> is set, then
 *         the return value indicates the necessary destination buffer size.
