','line_number':1,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Finds the set of characters and strings that sort differently in the tailoring
 * from the base data.
 *
 * Every mapping in the tailoring needs to be compared to the base,
 * because some mappings are copied for optimization, and
 * all contractions for a character are copied if any contractions for that character
 * are added, modified or removed.
 *
 * It might be simpler to re-parse the rule string, but:
 * - That would require duplicating some of the from-rules builder code.
 * - That would make the runtime code depend on the builder.
 * - That would only work if we have the rule string, and we allow users to
 *   omit the rule string from data files.
