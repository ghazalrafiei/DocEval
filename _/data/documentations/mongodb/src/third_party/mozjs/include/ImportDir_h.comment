 * Yes, this function may perform file I/O on the critical path during
 * startup. A mitigating factor here is that this function must be called
 * immediately after creating a process using the image specified by
 * |aFullImagePath|; by this point, the system has already paid the price of

 * @param aFullImagePath Wide-character string containing the absolute path

 * @param aTransferMgr   Encapsulating the transfer from the current process to
