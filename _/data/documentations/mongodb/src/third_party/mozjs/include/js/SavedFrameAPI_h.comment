 * Accessors for working with SavedFrame JSObjects
 *
 * Each of these functions assert that if their `HandleObject savedFrame`
 * argument is non-null, its JSClass is the SavedFrame class (or it is a
 * cross-compartment or Xray wrapper around an object with the SavedFrame class)
 * and the object is not the SavedFrame.prototype object.
 *
 * Each of these functions will find the first SavedFrame object in the chain
 * whose underlying stack frame principals are subsumed by the given
 * |principals|, and operate on that SavedFrame object. This prevents leaking
 * information about privileged frames to un-privileged callers
 *
 * The SavedFrame in parameters do _NOT_ need to be in the same compartment as
 * the cx, and the various out parameters are _NOT_ guaranteed to be in the same
 * compartment as cx.
 *
 * You may consider or skip over self-hosted frames by passing
 * `SavedFrameSelfHosted::Include` or `SavedFrameSelfHosted::Exclude`
 * respectively.
 *
 * Additionally, it may be the case that there is no such SavedFrame object
 * whose captured frame's principals are subsumed by |principals|! If the
 * `HandleObject savedFrame` argument is null, or the |principals| do not
 * subsume any of the chained SavedFrame object's principals,
 * `SavedFrameResult::AccessDenied` is returned and a (hopefully) sane default
 * value is chosen for the out param.
 *
 * See also `js/src/doc/SavedFrame/SavedFrame.md`.

 * Given a SavedFrame object, convert it and its transitive parents to plain

 * they cannot be usefully stringified to JSON. Assigning their properties to
 * plain objects allow those objects to be stringified and the saved frame stack
 * can be encoded as a string.
