 * Enable recording JS allocations. This feature hooks into the object creation
 * in the JavaScript engine, and reports back the allocation info through the
 * callback. This allocation tracking is turned on for all encountered realms.
 * The JS Debugger API can also turn on allocation tracking with its own
 * probability. If both allocation tracking mechanisms are turned on at the same
 * time, the Debugger's probability defers to the EnableRecordingAllocations's
 * probability setting.

 * Turn off JS allocation recording. If any JS Debuggers are also recording
 * allocations, then the probability will be reset to the Debugger's desired
