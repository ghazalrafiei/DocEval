 * Some cached data is, in addition to being build-specific, CPU-specific: the
 * cached data depends on CPU features like a particular level of SSE support.
 *
 * This function produces a buildId that includes:
 *
 *   * the buildId defined by the embedder-provided BuildIdOp set by
 *     JS::SetProcessBuildIdOp, and
 *   * CPU feature information for the current CPU.
 *
 * Embedders may use this function to tag cached data whose validity depends
 * on having consistent buildId *and* on the CPU supporting features identical
 * to those in play when the cached data was computed.

 * Script bytecode is dependent on the buildId and a few other things.
 *
 * This function produces a buildId that includes:
 *
 *   * The buildId defined by the embedder-provided BuildIdOp set by
 *     JS::SetProcessBuildIdOp.
 *   * Additional bytes describing things like endianness, pointer size and
 *     other state XDR buffers depend on.

 * Note: this value may depend on runtime preferences so isn't guaranteed to be
 * stable across restarts.
 *
 * Embedders should use this function to tag transcoded bytecode.
