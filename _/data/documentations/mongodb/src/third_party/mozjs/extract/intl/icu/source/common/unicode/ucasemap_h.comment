 * \brief C API: Unicode case mapping functions using a UCaseMap service object.
 *
 * The service object takes care of memory allocations, data loading, and setup
 * for the attributes, as usual.
 *
 * Currently, the functionality provided here does not overlap with uchar.h
 * and ustring.h, except for ucasemap_toTitle().
 *
 * ucasemap_utf8XYZ() functions operate directly on UTF-8 strings.

 * UCaseMap is an opaque service object for newer ICU case mapping functions.

 * Open a UCaseMap service object for a locale and a set of options.

 *               upper-/lower-/title-casing according to the Unicode standard.
 *               Usual semantics: ""=root, NULL=default locale, etc.
 * @param options Options bit set, used for case folding and string comparisons.
 *                Same flags as for u_foldCase(), u_strFoldCase(),
 *                u_strCaseCompare(), etc.
 *                Use 0 or U_FOLD_CASE_DEFAULT for default behavior.

 * Set the break iterator that is used for titlecasing.
 * The UCaseMap service object releases a previously set break iterator
 * and "adopts" this new one, taking ownership of it.
 * It will be released in a subsequent call to ucasemap_setBreakIterator()
 * or ucasemap_close().
 *
 * Break iterator operations are not thread-safe. Therefore, titlecasing
 * functions use non-const UCaseMap objects. It is not possible to titlecase

 * Titlecase a UTF-16 string. This function is almost a duplicate of u_strToTitle(),
 * except that it takes ucasemap_setOptions() into account and has performance
 * advantages from being able to use a UCaseMap object for multiple case mapping
 * operations, saving setup time.
 *
 * Casing is locale-dependent and context-sensitive.
 * Titlecasing uses a break iterator to find the first characters of words
 * that are to be titlecased. It titlecases those characters and lowercases
 * all others. (This can be modified with ucasemap_setOptions().)
 *
 * Note: This function takes a non-const UCaseMap pointer because it will
 * open a default break iterator if no break iterator was set yet,
 * and effectively call ucasemap_setBreakIterator();
 * also because the break iterator is stateful and will be modified during
 * the iteration.
 *
 * The titlecase break iterator can be provided to customize for arbitrary
 * styles, using rules and dictionaries beyond the standard iterators.
 * The standard titlecase iterator for the root locale implements the
 * algorithm of Unicode TR 21.
 *

 * provided break iterator.

 *                  the buffer is large enough.

 * @param destCapacity The size of the buffer (number of UChars). If it is 0, then
