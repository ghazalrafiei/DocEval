 * A mutable UnicodeString wrapper with a variable offset and length and
 * support for case folding. The charAt, length, and subSequence methods all
 * operate relative to the fixed offset into the UnicodeString.
 *
 * Intended to be useful for parsing.
 *
 * CAUTION: Since this class is mutable, it must not be used anywhere that an
 * immutable object is required, like in a cache or as the key of a hash map.

     * Equivalent to <code>setOffset(getOffset()+delta)</code>.

     * <p>
     * This method is usually called by a Matcher to register that a char was consumed. If the char is
     * strong (it usually is, except for things like whitespace), follow this with a call to
     * {@link ParsedNumber#setCharsConsumed}. For more information on strong chars, see that method.

     * Adjusts the offset by the width of the current code point, either 1 or 2 chars.
     ','line_number':47,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the first code point in the string segment, or -1 if the string starts with an invalid
     * code point.
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Important:</strong> Most of the time, you should use {@link #startsWith}, which handles case
     * folding logic, instead of this method.

     * Returns true if the first code point of this StringSegment equals the given code point.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method will perform case folding if case folding is enabled for the parser.
     ','line_number':76,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns true if the first code point of this StringSegment is in the given UnicodeSet.
     ','line_number':84,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns true if there is at least one code point of overlap between this StringSegment and the
     * given UnicodeString.
     ','line_number':89,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the length of the prefix shared by this StringSegment and the given UnicodeString. For
     * example, if this string segment is "aab", and the char sequence is "aac", this method returns 2,
     * since the first 2 characters are the same.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method only returns offsets along code point boundaries.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method will perform case folding if case folding was enabled in the constructor.
     *
     * <p>
     * IMPORTANT: The given UnicodeString must not be empty! It is the caller's responsibility to check.
     ','line_number':95,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Like {@link #getCommonPrefixLength}, but never performs case folding, even if case folding is
     * enabled for the parser.
