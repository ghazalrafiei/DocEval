   * This function is used to asynchronously read data from the stream socket.
   * The function call always returns immediately.
   *
   * @param buffers One or more buffers into which the data will be read.
   * Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the
   * underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee
   * that they remain valid until the handler is called.
   *
   * @param handler The handler to be called when the read operation completes.
   * Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of
   * the handler must be:
   * @code void handler(
   *   const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
   *   std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes read.
   * ); @endcode
   * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
   * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation
   * of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using
   * asio::io_context::post().
   *
   * @note The read operation may not read all of the requested number of bytes.
   * Consider using the @ref async_read function if you need to ensure that the
   * requested amount of data is read before the asynchronous operation
   * completes.
   *
   * @par Example
   * To read into a single data buffer use the @ref buffer function as follows:
   * @code
   * socket.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data, size), handler);
   * @endcode
   * See the @ref buffer documentation for information on reading into multiple
   * buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or
   * std::vector.
