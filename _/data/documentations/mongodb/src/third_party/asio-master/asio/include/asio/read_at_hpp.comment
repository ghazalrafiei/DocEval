 * amount of data at the specified offset before returning.

 * This function is used to read a certain number of bytes of data from a
 * random access device at the specified offset. The call will block until one
 * of the following conditions is true:
 *
 * @li The supplied buffers are full. That is, the bytes transferred is equal to
 * the sum of the buffer sizes.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the device's
 * read_some_at function.
 *
 * @param d The device from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the SyncRandomAccessReadDevice concept.
 *
 * @param offset The offset at which the data will be read.
 *
 * @param buffers One or more buffers into which the data will be read. The sum
 * of the buffer sizes indicates the maximum number of bytes to read from the
 * device.
 *
 * @returns The number of bytes transferred.
 *
 * @throws asio::system_error Thrown on failure.
 *
 * @par Example
 * To read into a single data buffer use the @ref buffer function as follows:
 * @code asio::read_at(d, 42, asio::buffer(data, size)); @endcode
 * See the @ref buffer documentation for information on reading into multiple
 * buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or
