        http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html ','line_number':37,'multiline':True]['text':' opaque data-structure ','line_number':62,'multiline':True]['text':' forward-declaration ','line_number':63,'multiline':True]['text':' The C++ ABI requires exception_class, private_1, and private_2 to
   be of type uint64 and the entire structure to be
   double-word-aligned. Please note that exception_class stays 64-bit 
   even on 32-bit machines for gcc compatibility.  ','line_number':74,'multiline':True]['text':' Callback for _Unwind_Backtrace().  The backtrace stops immediately
   if the callback returns any value other than _URC_NO_REASON. ','line_number':101,'multiline':True]['text':' See http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2001-09/msg00082.html for why
   _UA_END_OF_STACK exists.  ','line_number':106,'multiline':True]['text':' If the unwind was initiated due to a forced unwind, resume that
   operation, else re-raise the exception.  This is used by
   __cxa_rethrow().  ','line_number':110,'multiline':True]['text':' See http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2003-09/msg00154.html for why
   _Unwind_GetBSP() exists.  ','line_number':116,'multiline':True]['text':' Return the "canonical frame address" for the given context.
   This is used by NPTL... ','line_number':120,'multiline':True]['text':' Return the base-address for data references.  ','line_number':124,'multiline':True]['text':' Return the base-address for text references.  ','line_number':127,'multiline':True]['text':' Call _Unwind_Trace_Fn once for each stack-frame, without doing any
   cleanup.  The first frame for which the callback is invoked is the
   one for the caller of _Unwind_Backtrace().  _Unwind_Backtrace()
   returns _URC_END_OF_STACK when the backtrace stopped due to
   reaching the end of the call-chain or _URC_FATAL_PHASE1_ERROR if it
   stops for any other reason.  ','line_number':130,'multiline':True]['text':' Find the start-address of the procedure containing the specified IP
   or NULL if it cannot be found (e.g., because the function has no
   unwind info).  Note: there is not necessarily a one-to-one
   correspondence between source-level functions and procedures: some
   functions don't have unwind-info and others are split into multiple
   procedures.  ','line_number':138,'multiline':True]['text':' See also Linux Standard Base Spec:
