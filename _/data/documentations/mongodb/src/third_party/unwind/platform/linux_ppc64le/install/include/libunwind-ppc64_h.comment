   Copied from libunwind-x86_64.h, modified slightly for building
   frysk successfully on ppc64, by Wu Zhou <woodzltc@cn.ibm.com>
   Will be replaced when libunwind is ready on ppc64 platform.

 * This needs to be big enough to accommodate "struct cursor", while
 * leaving some slack for future expansion.  Changing this value will
 * require recompiling all users of this library.  Stack allocation is
 * relatively cheap and unwind-state copying is relatively rare, so we want
 * to err on making it rather too big than too small.
 *
 * To simplify this whole process, we are at least initially taking the
 * tack that UNW_PPC64_* map straight across to the .eh_frame column register
 * numbers.  These register numbers come from gcc's source in
 * gcc/config/rs6000/rs6000.h
 *
 * UNW_TDEP_CURSOR_LEN is in terms of unw_word_t size.  Since we have 115
 * elements in the loc array, each sized 2 * unw_word_t, plus the rest of
 * the cursor struct, this puts us at about 2 * 115 + 40 = 270.  Let's
 * round that up to 280.

       info is what this implementation uses for unwinding, we have no way
       to unwind this register, and so we will not expose an FPSCR register
       number in the libunwind API.
