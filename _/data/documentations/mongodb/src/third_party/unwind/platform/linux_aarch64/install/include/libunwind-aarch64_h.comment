   leaving some slack for future expansion.  Changing this value will
   require recompiling all users of this library.  Stack allocation is
   relatively cheap and unwind-state copying is relatively rare, so we
   want to err on making it rather too big than too small.

   Calculation is regs used (64 + 34) * 2 + 40 (bytes of rest of
   cursor) + padding
