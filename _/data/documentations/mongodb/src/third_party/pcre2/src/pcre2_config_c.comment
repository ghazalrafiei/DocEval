The stack is no longer used via recursion for

  PCRE2_PRERELEASE is set to an empty string (which it is for real releases).
  If the second alternative is used in this case, it does not leave a space
  before the date. On the other hand, if all four macros are put into a single
  XSTRING when PCRE2_PRERELEASE is not empty, an unwanted space is inserted.
  There are problems using an "obvious" approach like this:

     XSTRING(PCRE2_MAJOR) "." XSTRING(PCRE_MINOR)
     XSTRING(PCRE2_PRERELEASE) " " XSTRING(PCRE_DATE)

  because, when PCRE2_PRERELEASE is empty, this leads to an attempted expansion
  of STRING(). The C standard states: "If (before argument substitution) any
  argument consists of no preprocessing tokens, the behavior is undefined." It
  turns out the gcc treats this case as a single empty string - which is what
  we really want - but Visual C grumbles about the lack of an argument for the
  macro. Unfortunately, both are within their rights. As there seems to be no
  way to test for a macro's value being empty at compile time, we have to
  resort to a runtime test. ','line_number':220,'multiline':True]['text':' End of pcre2_config.c ','line_number':252,'multiline':True]
