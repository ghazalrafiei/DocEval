['text':'**************************************************************************
Fuzzer driver for PCRE2. Given an arbitrary string of bytes and a length, it
tries to compile and match it, deriving options from the string itself. If
STANDALONE is defined, a main program that calls the driver with the contents
of specified files is compiled, and commentary on what is happening is output.
If an argument starts with '=' the rest of it it is taken as a literal string
rather than a file name. This allows easy testing of short strings.

are more than 100 callouts, as one way of stopping too much time being spent on

input is UTF-8. Also unset PCRE2_NEVER_UTF and PCRE2_NEVER_UCP as there is no
reason to disallow UTF and UCP. Force PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C to be set because
\C in random patterns is highly likely to cause a crash. ','line_number':84,'multiline':True]['text':' Discard partial matching if PCRE2_ENDANCHORED is set, because they are not
