','line_number':5,'multiline':True]['text':' This module contains an internal function that is used to match a Unicode
extended grapheme sequence. It is used by both pcre2_match() and
pcre2_def_match(). However, it is called only when Unicode support is being
compiled. Nevertheless, we provide a dummy function when there is no Unicode
support, because some compilers do not like functionless source files. ','line_number':41,'multiline':True]['text':' Dummy function ','line_number':56,'multiline':True]['text':'************************************************
