and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

','line_number':5,'multiline':True]['text':' This module contains internal functions for testing newlines when more than
one kind of newline is to be recognized. When a newline is found, its length is
returned. In principle, we could implement several newline "types", each
referring to a different set of newline characters. At present, PCRE2 supports
only NLTYPE_FIXED, which gets handled without these functions, NLTYPE_ANYCRLF,
and NLTYPE_ANY. The full list of Unicode newline characters is taken from
http://unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr18/. ','line_number':42,'multiline':True]['text':'************************************************
*      Check for newline at given position       *
************************************************','line_number':59,'multiline':True]['text':' This function is called only via the IS_NEWLINE macro, which does so only
when the newline type is NLTYPE_ANY or NLTYPE_ANYCRLF. The case of a fixed
newline (NLTYPE_FIXED) is handled inline. It is guaranteed that the code unit
pointed to by ptr is less than the end of the string.

Arguments:
  ptr          pointer to possible newline
  type         the newline type
  endptr       pointer to the end of the string
  lenptr       where to return the length
