','line_number':5,'multiline':True]['text':' This module contains functions for scanning a compiled pattern and

*   Find the minimum subject length for a group  *
************************************************','line_number':64,'multiline':True]['text':' Scan a parenthesized group and compute the minimum length of subject that
is needed to match it. This is a lower bound; it does not mean there is a
string of that length that matches. In UTF mode, the result is in characters
rather than code units. The field in a compiled pattern for storing the minimum
length is 16-bits long (on the grounds that anything longer than that is
pathological), so we give up when we reach that amount. This also means that
integer overflow for really crazy patterns cannot happen.

Backreference minimum lengths are cached to speed up multiple references. This
function is called only when the highest back reference in the pattern is less
than or equal to MAX_CACHE_BACKREF, which is one less than the size of the
caching vector. The zeroth element contains the number of the highest set
value.

Arguments:
  re              compiled pattern block
  code            pointer to start of group (the bracket)
  startcode       pointer to start of the whole pattern's code
  utf             UTF flag
  recurses        chain of recurse_check to catch mutual recursion
  countptr        pointer to call count (to catch over complexity)
  backref_cache   vector for caching back references.

This function is no longer called when the pattern contains (*ACCEPT); however,
the old code for returning -1 is retained, just in case.

Returns:   the minimum length
           -1 \C in UTF-8 mode
              or (*ACCEPT)

    length, so we don't add anything. This covers the DEFINE "condition"
    automatically. If there are two branches we can treat it the same as any
    other non-capturing subpattern. ','line_number':153,'multiline':True]['text':' There's a special case of OP_BRA, when it is wrapped round a repeated
    OP_RECURSE. We'd like to process the latter at this level so that

    one. ','line_number':370,'multiline':True]['text':' The single-byte matcher means we can't proceed in UTF mode. (In
    non-UTF mode \C will actually be turned into OP_ALLANY, so won't ever
    appear, but leave the code, just in case.) ','line_number':378,'multiline':True]['text':' For repeated character types, we have to test for \p and \P, which have
    an extra two bytes of parameters. ','line_number':390,'multiline':True]['text':' Check a class for variable quantification ','line_number':411,'multiline':True]['text':' The original code caused an unsigned overflow in 64 bit systems,
    so now we use a conditional statement. ','line_number':417,'multiline':True]['text':' Fall through ','line_number':433,'multiline':True]['text':' Backreferences and subroutine calls (OP_RECURSE) are treated in the same
    way: we find the minimum length for the subpattern. A recursion
    (backreference or subroutine) causes an a flag to be set that causes the
    length of this branch to be ignored. The logic is that a recursion can only
    make sense if there is another alternative that stops the recursing. That
    will provide the minimum length (when no recursion happens).

    If PCRE2_MATCH_UNSET_BACKREF is set, a backreference to an unset bracket
    matches an empty string (by default it causes a matching failure), so in
    that case we must set the minimum length to zero.

    For backreferenes, if duplicate numbers are present in the pattern we check
    for a reference to a duplicate. If it is, we don't know which version will
    be referenced, so we have to set the minimum length to zero. ','line_number':457,'multiline':True]['text':' Duplicate named pattern back reference.

     product is not greater than INT_MAX. (2) branchlength is limited to
     UINT16_MAX (checked at the top of the loop). ','line_number':629,'multiline':True]['text':' Recursion always refers to the first occurrence of a subpattern with a

    ASCII characters, so they could be omitted from this list. However, in
    future that may change, so we include them here so as not to leave a

least one Windows environment, some higher bytes bits were set in the tables.
So we deal with that case by considering the UTF-8 encoding.

In UTF-8 mode, we can only do a direct setting for bytes less than 128, as
otherwise there can be confusion with bytes in the middle of UTF-8 characters.
Unlike in the positive case, where we can set appropriate starting bits for
specific high-valued UTF-8 characters, in this case we have to set the bits for
all high-valued characters. The lowest is 0xc2, but we overkill by starting at
0xc0 (192) for simplicity.

************************************************','line_number':919,'multiline':True]['text':' This function scans a compiled unanchored expression recursively and
attempts to build a bitmap of the set of possible starting code units whose
values are less than 256. In 16-bit and 32-bit mode, values above 255 all cause
the 255 bit to be set. When calling set[_not]_type_bits() in UTF-8 (sic) mode
we pass a value of 16 rather than 32 as the final argument. (See comments in
those functions for the reason.)

The SSB_CONTINUE return is useful for parenthesized groups in patterns such as
(a*)b where the group provides some optional starting code units but scanning
must continue at the outer level to find at least one mandatory code unit. At
the outermost level, this function fails unless the result is SSB_DONE.

We restrict recursion (for nested groups) to 1000 to avoid stack overflow
issues.

','line_number':1659,'multiline':True]['text':' Find start of compiled code ','line_number':1679,'multiline':True]['text':' For a pattern that has a first code unit, or a multiline pattern that
matches only at "line start", there is no point in seeking a list of starting
code units. ','line_number':1684,'multiline':True]['text':' If a list of starting code units was set up, scan the list to see if only
  one or two were listed. Having only one listed is rare because usually a
  single starting code unit will have been recognized and PCRE2_FIRSTSET set.
  If two are listed, see if they are caseless versions of the same character;
  if so we can replace the list with a caseless first code unit. This gives
  better performance and is plausibly worth doing for patterns such as [Ww]ord
  or (word|WORD). ','line_number':1694,'multiline':True]['text':' Least significant bit ','line_number':1716,'multiline':True]['text':' More than one bit set ','line_number':1717,'multiline':True]['text':' In the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries, the bit for 0xff means "0xff and
        all wide characters", so we cannot use it here. ','line_number':1719,'multiline':True]['text':' Compute the character value ','line_number':1726,'multiline':True]['text':' c contains the code unit value, in the range 0-255. In 8-bit UTF
        mode, only values < 128 can be used. In all the other cases, c is a
        character value.

    is not the same as a required later code unit. This is because a search for
    a required code unit starts after an explicit first code unit, but at a
    code unit found from the bitmap. Patterns such as /a*a/ don't work
    if both the start unit and required unit are the same. ','line_number':1765,'multiline':True]['text':' Find the minimum length of subject string. If the pattern can match an empty
string, the minimum length is already known. If the pattern contains (*ACCEPT)
all bets are off, and we don't even try to find a minimum length. If there are
more back references than the size of the vector we are going to cache them in,
do nothing. A pattern that complicated will probably take a long time to
analyze and may in any case turn out to be too complicated. Note that back
reference minima are held as 16-bit numbers.
