   This file contains a simple executable memory allocator

   It is assumed, that executable code blocks are usually medium (or sometimes
   large) memory blocks, and the allocator is not too frequently called (less
   optimized than other allocators). Thus, using it as a generic allocator is
   not suggested.

   How does it work:
     Memory is allocated in continuous memory areas called chunks by alloc_chunk()
     Chunk format:
     [ block ][ block ] ... [ block ][ block terminator ]

   All blocks and the block terminator is started with block_header. The block
   header contains the size of the previous and the next block. These sizes
   can also contain special values.
     Block size:
       0 - The block is a free_block, with a different size member.
       1 - The block is a block terminator.
       n - The block is used at the moment, and the value contains its size.
     Previous block size:
       0 - This is the first block of the memory chunk.
       n - The size of the previous block.

   Using these size values we can go forward or backward on the block chain.
   The unused blocks are stored in a chain list pointed by free_blocks. This
   list is useful if we need to find a suitable memory area when the allocator
   is called.

   When a block is freed, the new free block is connected to its adjacent free
   blocks if possible.

     [ free block ][ used block ][ free block ]
   and "used block" is freed, the three blocks are connected together:
     [           one big free block           ]
