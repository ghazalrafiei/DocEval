*              Do a JIT pattern match            *
************************************************','line_number':63,'multiline':True]['text':' This function runs a JIT pattern match.

Arguments:
  code            points to the compiled expression
  subject         points to the subject string
  length          length of subject string (may contain binary zeros)
  start_offset    where to start in the subject string
  options         option bits
  match_data      points to a match_data block
  mcontext        points to a match context

Returns:          > 0 => success; value is the number of ovector pairs filled
                  = 0 => success, but ovector is not big enough
                   -1 => failed to match (PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH)
                 < -1 => some kind of unexpected problem
