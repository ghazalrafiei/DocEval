and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

','line_number':5,'multiline':True]['text':' This module contains some fixed tables that are used by more than one of the
PCRE2 code modules. The tables are also #included by the pcre2test program,
which uses macros to change their names from _pcre2_xxx to xxxx, thereby
avoiding name clashes with the library. In this case, PCRE2_PCRE2TEST is
defined. ','line_number':41,'multiline':True]['text':' We're compiling the library ','line_number':47,'multiline':True]['text':' PCRE2_PCRE2TEST ','line_number':52,'multiline':True]['text':' Table of sizes for the fixed-length opcodes. It's defined in a macro so that

cluster. Every code point has a grapheme break property which is one of the
ucp_gbXX values defined in pcre2_ucp.h. These changed between Unicode versions
10 and 11. The 2-dimensional table is indexed by the properties of two adjacent
code points. The left property selects a word from the table, and the right
property selects a bit from that word like this:

  PRIV(ucp_gbtable)[left-property] & (1u << right-property)

The value is non-zero if a grapheme break is NOT permitted between the relevant
two code points. The breaking rules are as follows:

1. Break at the start and end of text (pretty obviously).

2. Do not break between a CR and LF; otherwise, break before and after
   controls.

3. Do not break Hangul syllable sequences, the rules for which are:

    L may be followed by L, V, LV or LVT
    LV or V may be followed by V or T
    LVT or T may be followed by T

4. Do not break before extending characters or zero-width-joiner (ZWJ).

The following rules are only for extended grapheme clusters (but that's what we
are implementing).

5. Do not break before SpacingMarks.

6. Do not break after Prepend characters.

7. Do not break within emoji modifier sequences or emoji zwj sequences. That
   is, do not break between characters with the Extended_Pictographic property.
   Extend and ZWJ characters are allowed between the characters; this cannot be
   represented in this table, the code has to deal with it.

8. Do not break within emoji flag sequences. That is, do not break between
   regional indicator (RI) symbols if there are an odd number of RI characters
   before the break point. This table encodes "join RI characters"; the code
   has to deal with checking for previous adjoining RIs.

9. Otherwise, break everywhere.
