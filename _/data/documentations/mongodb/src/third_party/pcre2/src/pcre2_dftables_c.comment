','line_number':5,'multiline':True]['text':' This is a freestanding support program to generate a file containing
character tables for PCRE2. The tables are built using the pcre2_maketables()
function, which is part of the PCRE2 API. By default, the system's "C" locale
is used rather than what the building user happens to have set, but the -L
option can be used to select the current locale from the LC_ALL environment
variable. By default, the tables are written in source form, but if -b is
given, they are written in binary. ','line_number':42,'multiline':True]['text':' Must be set, but not relevant here ','line_number':59,'multiline':True]['text':' pcre2_maketables.c notices this ','line_number':62,'multiline':True]['text':'************************************************
