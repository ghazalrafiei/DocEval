   This file contains a simple W^X executable memory allocator for POSIX
   like systems and Windows

   In *NIX, MAP_ANON is required (that is considered a feature) so make
   sure to set the right availability macros for your system or the code
   will fail to build.

   If your system doesn't support mapping of anonymous pages (ex: IRIX) it
   is also likely that it doesn't need this allocator and should be using
   the standard one instead.

   It allocates a separate map for each code block and may waste a lot of
   memory, because whatever was requested, will be rounded up to the page
   size (minimum 4KB, but could be even bigger).

   It changes the page permissions (RW <-> RX) as needed and therefore, if you
   will be updating the code after it has been generated, need to make sure to
   block any concurrent execution, or could result in a SIGBUS, that could
   even manifest itself at a different address than the one that was being
   modified.

   Only use if you are unable to use the regular allocator because of security
   restrictions and adding exceptions to your application or the system are
   not possible.
