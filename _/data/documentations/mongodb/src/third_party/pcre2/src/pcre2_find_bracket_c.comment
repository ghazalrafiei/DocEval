','line_number':5,'multiline':True]['text':' This module contains a single function that scans through a compiled pattern
until it finds a capturing bracket with the given number, or, if the number is
negative, an instance of OP_REVERSE for a lookbehind. The function is called
from pcre2_compile.c and also from pcre2_study.c when finding the minimum
matching length. ','line_number':42,'multiline':True]['text':'************************************************

************************************************','line_number':56,'multiline':True]['text':'
Arguments:
  code        points to start of expression
  utf         TRUE in UTF mode
  number      the required bracket number or negative to find a lookbehind

Returns:      pointer to the opcode for the bracket, or NULL if not found
','line_number':60,'multiline':True]['text':' XCLASS is used for classes that cannot be represented just by a bit map.
  This includes negated single high-valued characters. CALLOUT_STR is used for
  callouts with string arguments. In both cases the length in the table is
  zero; the actual length is stored in the compiled code. ','line_number':78,'multiline':True]['text':' Handle lookbehind ','line_number':86,'multiline':True]['text':' Handle capturing bracket ','line_number':94,'multiline':True]['text':' Otherwise, we can get the item's length from the table, except that for
  repeated character types, we have to test for \p and \P, which have an extra
  two bytes of parameters, and for MARK/PRUNE/SKIP/THEN with an argument, we
  must add in its length. ','line_number':104,'multiline':True]['text':' Add in the fixed length from the table ','line_number':142,'multiline':True]['text':' In UTF-8 and UTF-16 modes, opcodes that are followed by a character may be
  followed by a multi-byte character. The length in the table is a minimum, so
  we have to arrange to skip the extra bytes.
