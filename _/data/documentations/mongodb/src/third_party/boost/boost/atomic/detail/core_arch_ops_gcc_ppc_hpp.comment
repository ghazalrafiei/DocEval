    Refer to: Motorola: "Programming Environments Manual for 32-Bit
    Implementations of the PowerPC Architecture", Appendix E:
    "Synchronization Programming Examples" for an explanation of what is
    going on here (can be found on the web at various places by the
    name "MPCFPE32B.pdf", Google is your friend...)

    Most of the atomic operations map to instructions in a relatively
    straight-forward fashion, but "load"s may at first glance appear
    a bit strange as they map to:

            lwz %rX, addr
            cmpw %rX, %rX
            bne- 1f
        1:

    That is, the CPU is forced to perform a branch that "formally" depends
    on the value retrieved from memory. This scheme has an overhead of
    about 1-2 clock cycles per load, but it allows to map "acquire" to
    the "isync" instruction instead of "sync" uniformly and for all type
    of atomic operations. Since "isync" has a cost of about 15 clock
    cycles, while "sync" hast a cost of about 50 clock cycles, the small
    penalty to atomic loads more than compensates for this.

    Byte- and halfword-sized atomic values are implemented in two ways.
    When 8 and 16-bit instructions are available (in Power8 and later),
    they are used. Otherwise operations are realized by encoding the
    value to be represented into a word, performing sign/zero extension
    as appropriate. This means that after add/sub operations the value
    needs fixing up to accurately preserve the wrap-around semantic of
    the smaller type. (Nothing special needs to be done for the bit-wise
    and the "exchange type" operators as the compiler already sees to
    it that values carried in registers are extended appropriately and
    everything falls into place naturally).

    The register constraint "b"  instructs gcc to use any register
    except r0; this is sometimes required because the encoding for
    r0 is used to signify "constant zero" in a number of instructions,
    making r0 unusable in this place. For simplicity this constraint
    is used everywhere since I am to lazy to look this up on a
    per-instruction basis, and ppc has enough registers for this not
    to pose a problem.
