 * \brief Logging library core class
 *
 * The logging core is used to interconnect log sources and sinks. It also provides
 * a number of basic features, like global filtering and global and thread-specific attribute storage.
 *
 * The logging core is a singleton. Users can acquire the core instance by calling the static method <tt>get</tt>.

     * \return The method returns a pointer to the logging core singleton instance.
     ','line_number':87,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method enables or disables logging.
     *
     * Setting this status to \c false allows you to completely wipe out any logging activity, including
     * filtering and generation of attribute values. It is useful if you want to completely disable logging
     * in a running application. The state of logging does not alter any other properties of the logging
     * library, such as filters or sinks, so you can enable logging with the very same settings that you had
     * when the logging was disabled.
     * This feature may also be useful if you want to perform major changes to logging configuration and
     * don't want your application to block on opening or pushing a log record.
     *
     * By default logging is enabled.
     *
     * \param enabled The actual flag of logging activity.
     * \return The previous value of enabled/disabled logging flag
     ','line_number':92,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method allows to detect if logging is enabled. See the comment for \c set_logging_enabled.
     ','line_number':109,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method sets the global logging filter. The filter is applied to every log record that is processed.
     *
     * \param filter The filter function object to be installed.
     ','line_number':114,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method removes the global logging filter. All log records are passed to sinks without global filtering applied.
     ','line_number':120,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method adds a new sink. The sink is included into logging process immediately after being added and until being removed.
     * No sink can be added more than once at the same time. If the sink is already registered, the call is ignored.
     *
     * \param s The sink to be registered.
     ','line_number':125,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method removes the sink from the output. The sink will not receive any log records after removal.
     * The call has no effect if the sink is not registered.
     *
     * \param s The sink to be unregistered.
     ','line_number':132,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method removes all registered sinks from the output. The sinks will not receive any log records after removal.
     ','line_number':139,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method performs flush on all registered sinks.
     *
     * \note This method may take long time to complete as it may block until all sinks manage to process all buffered log records.
     *       The call will also block all logging attempts until the operation completes.
     ','line_number':144,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method adds an attribute to the global attribute set. The attribute will be implicitly added to every log record.
     *
     * \param name The attribute name.
     * \param attr The attribute factory.
     * \return A pair of values. If the second member is \c true, then the attribute is added and the first member points to the
     *         attribute. Otherwise the attribute was not added and the first member points to the attribute that prevents
     *         addition.
     ','line_number':152,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method removes an attribute from the global attribute set.
     *
     * \pre The attribute was added with the \c add_global_attribute call.
     * \post The attribute is no longer registered as a global attribute. The iterator is invalidated after removal.
     *
     * \param it Iterator to the previously added attribute.
     ','line_number':162,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method returns a copy of the complete set of currently registered global attributes.
     ','line_number':172,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method replaces the complete set of currently registered global attributes with the provided set.
     *
     * \note The method invalidates all iterators and references that may have been returned
     *       from the \c add_global_attribute method.
     *
     * \param attrs The set of attributes to be installed.
     ','line_number':176,'multiline':True]['text':'!
     * The method adds an attribute to the thread-specific attribute set. The attribute will be implicitly added to
     * every log record made in the current thread.
     *
     * \note In single-threaded build the effect is the same as adding the attribute globally. This, however, does
     *       not imply that iterators to thread-specific and global attributes are interchangeable.
     *
     * \param name The attribute name.
     * \param attr The attribute factory.
     * \return A pair of values. If the second member is \c true, then the attribute is added and the first member points to the
     *         attribute. Otherwise the attribute was not added and the first member points to the attribute that prevents
     *         addition.

     * The method removes an attribute from the thread-specific attribute set.

     * \param it Iterator to the previously added attribute.
     ','line_number':202,'multiline':True]['text':'!

     * The method sets exception handler function. The function will be called with no arguments
     * in case if an exception occurs during either \c open_record or \c push_record method
     * execution. Since exception handler is called from a \c catch statement, the exception
     * can be rethrown in order to determine its type.
     *
     * By default no handler is installed, thus any exception is propagated as usual.
     *
     * \sa See also: <tt>utility/exception_handler.hpp</tt>
     * \param handler Exception handling function
     *
     * \note The exception handler can be invoked in several threads concurrently.
     *       Thread interruptions are not affected by exception handlers.

     * The method attempts to open a new record to be written. While attempting to open a log record all filtering is applied.
     * A successfully opened record can be pushed further to sinks by calling the \c push_record method or simply destroyed by
     * destroying the returned object.
     *
     * More than one open records are allowed, such records exist independently. All attribute values are acquired during opening
     * the record and do not interact between records.
     *
     * The returned records can be copied, however, they must not be passed between different threads.
     *
     * \param source_attributes The set of source-specific attributes to be attached to the record to be opened.
     * \return A valid log record if the record is opened, an invalid record object if not (e.g. because it didn't pass filtering).
     *
     * \b Throws: If an exception handler is installed, only throws if the handler throws. Otherwise may
     *            throw if one of the sinks throws, or some system resource limitation is reached.
