 * @li All of the data in the supplied buffers has been written. That is, the

 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's

 * program must ensure that the stream performs no other write operations (such
 * as async_write, the stream's async_write_some function, or any other composed
 * operations that perform writes) until this operation completes.
 *
 * @param s The stream to which the data is to be written. The type must support
 * the AsyncWriteStream concept.
 *
 * @param buffers One or more buffers containing the data to be written.
 * Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the

 * completion handler, which will be called when the write completes.
 * Potential completion tokens include @ref use_future, @ref use_awaitable,
 * @ref yield_context, or a function object with the correct completion
 * signature. The function signature of the completion handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   // Result of operation.

 *   // occurred, this will be less than the sum of the buffer sizes.
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the completion handler will not be invoked from within this function.
 * On immediate completion, invocation of the handler will be performed in a
 * manner equivalent to using boost::asio::post().
