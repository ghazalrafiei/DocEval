 * MSVC 7.1/8.0 seem to have a similar problem, though the conditions in
 * which the error happens are not that simple. I have yet to isolate this
 * into a snippet suitable for bug reporting.
 * Sun Studio also has this problem, which might be related, from the
 * information gathered at Sun forums, with a known issue notified at the
 * internal bug report 6421933. The bug is present up to Studio Express 2,
 * the latest preview version of the future Sun Studio 12. As of this writing
 * (October 2006) it is not known whether a fix will finally make it into the
 * official Sun Studio 12.
