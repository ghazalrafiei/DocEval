**  SUMMARY OF BUILD INFORMATION
**  ----------------------------
**
**  Since the total size of the constants and tables required to build the power
**  routines is large, by default we assume that the constants will be shared
**  whenever possible between data types and functions.  Switches are provided
**  to over-ride the default sharing behavior.
**
**  Also, there is a switch to determine if the argument reduction scheme for
**  the accurate power routine uses a divide operation or not.  The default is
**  to not use divide.
**
**  The following table summerizes the supportted switches
**
**	   Switch		                  Meaning
**	-----------	-------------------------------------------------
**	NO_FAST		Don't generate values for the fast routines.
**
**	NO_ACC		Don't generate values for the accurate routines.
**
**	ONE_TYPE	Only generate values for the specified type 
**
**	USE_DIVIDE	Generate constant necessary for doing the log argument
**			    reduction using division
**
**  The defualt values of the above switches are a function of data type:
**
**				     Default
**				---------------------
**		   Switch	Single  Double  Quad 
**		-----------	---------------------
**		NO_FAST		False	False	True
**		NO_ACC		False	False	False
**		ONE_TYPE	False	False	True
**		USE_DIVIDE	False	False	True
**
**
**		NOTE: when sharing the generated table between type,
**		the larger precision type must be specified when
**		processing this file.
**
**  In addition to the above build flags, users can also specify the size
**  (actually, the log2 of the size) of the exp and log tables by defining
**  POW2_K and LOG2_K respectively.  The default values are POW2_K = 8 and
**  LOG2_K = 7.  The implications of changing these values is discussed
**  below.  (Look for the string "DEFINING THE TABLE SIZES");

    ** GENERATING POLYNOMIAL COEFFICIENTS:
    ** -----------------------------------
    **
    ** All of the polynomial coefficients in this file are generated via the 
    ** Remes min/max error algorithm.  This algorithm takes as one of its input
    ** arguments, the function to be approximated, F(x).  For example, if we
    ** look at generating the exp and pow polynomials, F(x) can be one of e^x,
    ** (e^x - 1)/x, [e^x - (1 + x)]/x^2, 2^x, or (2^x - 1)/x.
    **
    ** In order to minimize the number of different functions defined for remes
    ** algorithm, we define F(x) as a polynomial evaluation routine, with an
    ** external (global) scale factor and initial term.  This not only reduces
    ** the number of functions that need to be defined, but also reduces the
    ** required MP precision in the calculation of the coefficients, since,
    ** the cancellation error in computations like e^x - 1 and log(x) -
    ** (x - x^2/2) have been eliminated.
    **
    ** Also, in order to insure the polynomial evaluation macro matches the
    ** coefficients, the invocation of genpoly that generates the evaluation
    ** macros is encoded as a macro definition at the time the coefficients
    ** are generated.  The macro is instantiated after the constant table is
    ** generated. 
    **
    ** Lastly, each set of coefficients is generated into the array 'coefs', so
    ** that it can be printed via a subroutine.  This requires that the 
    ** coefficients are printed immediately after they are generated.

    ** GENERAL DISCUSSION OF 2^x, e^x and 10^x
    ** ---------------------------------------
    **
    ** The computation of b^x for b = 2, e and 10 is based on a table look-up
    ** scheme, where the number of entries in the table is a power of 2,
    ** say 2^k.  Writing x*(lnb/ln2) as the sum of its integer, first k fraction
    ** bits and a reduced arguement we have:
    **
    **		x(lnb/ln2) = I + j/2^k + w,	|w| < 2^(k+1) 
    **
    ** Letting z = w*(ln2/lnb) = x - (I + j/2^k)*(ln2/lnb), the computation of
    ** e^x proceeds as:
    **
    **		b^x = 2^(x(lnb/ln2))
    **		    = 2^(I + j/2^k + w)
    **		    = 2^I * 2^(j/2^k) * 2^w
    **		    = 2^I * 2^(j/2^k) * e^z
    **		    = 2^I * 2^(j/2^k) * [ 1 + z*p(z) ]			(1)
    **
    ** In (1), the alignment shift between 1 and z*p(z) is at least k+1 bits,
    ** so if care is taken in computing 2^I*2^(j/2^k) high accuracy in the
    ** final answer is possible.  Toward this end, we suppose the values of 
    ** 2^(j/2^k) are stored in a table in hi and lo pieces, T(j) and L(j).
    ** Then (1) can be re-written as:
    **
    **		b^x = 2^I * 2^(j/2^k) * [ 1 + z*p(z) ]
    **		    = 2^I * [ T(j) + L(j) ] * [ 1 + z*p(z) ]
    **		    = 2^I * { T(j) + L(j) + [ T(j) + L(j) ]*z*p(z) }
    **		     
    ** There are various way to define T(j) and L(j) so that "extra"
    ** precision is obtained.  The definition we use here was chosen to
    ** optimize the performance of the fast exp and pow routines.  In
    ** particular:
    **
    **			T(j) = bround( 2^(j/2^k), F_PRECISION) 
    **			L(j) = 2^(j/2^k) - T(j)
    **
    ** With this definition, the term L(j)*z*p(z) is insignificant in the
    ** final sum and may be dropped, so that e^x can be approximated by:
    **
    **		b^x = 2^I * { T(j) + [ L(j) + T(j)*z*p(z) ] }	(2)
    **
    ** In order to expose more parallelism in the computation, rather than
    ** storing the values of T(j) and L(j) in the tables, we store T(j) and
    ** R(j) = L(j)/T(j) and write (2) as:
    **
    **		b^x = 2^I * { T(j) + [ L(j) + T(j)*z*p(z) ] }
    **		    = 2^I * { T(j) + T(j)* [ R(j) + z*p(z) ] }
    **		    = 2^I * T(j) + 2^I*T(j)* [ R(j) + z*p(z) ] 
    **		    = V(I,j) + V(I, j)* [ R(j) + z*p(z) ] 		(3)
    **
    ** where V(I,j) = 2^I * T(j).  Note that on pipelined architectures,
    ** R(j) + z*p(z) can be computed with the same latancy as z*p(z) and
    ** on architectures with multiple functional units V(I,j) can be computed
    ** in the integer unit while R(j) + z*p(z) is computed in the floating
    ** point unit.

    ** POW2 TABLE

    ** is available or not.

    ** When back up precision is not available, the table contain the values

    ** Error Checking:
    ** ---------------
    **
    ** b^x can both underflow and overflow. Consequently some type of error
    ** check (screening) must eventually take place.  Since the appropriate
    ** timing and nature of the screening varies from function to function, it
    ** is discussed with the individual functions.
    **
    ** That said, all of the function using the pow2 table, have a "final"
    ** underflow/overflow check near the very end of the routine.  The check
    ** is based on the fact that the computation of V(I,j) is done in an
    ** integer register and provides a very good approximation to the final
    ** answer.  We can use integer comparisons on the bit pattern for V(I,j)
    ** to eliminate all potential overflows and underflows just prior to or
    ** just after the last floating point operation(s).
    ','line_number':519,'multiline':True]['text':'
    ** Computation of I, j and w:
    ** --------------------------
    **
    ** From the above discussion, we see that at some point in the evaluation
    ** of b^x, we need to take a floating point value and break it into its
    ** integer part, high fraction bits and low fraction bits.  If z is the
    ** value we want to break apart, then the conceptual computation that is
    ** performed is:
    **
    **		t <-- rint(2^k*z)
    **		w = z - t/2^k
    **		m <-- (WORD) t
    **		i <-- m >> k
    **		j <-- m & (2^k - 1)
    **
    ** In actuality, the first three steps of the above is performed by taking
    ** z, adding and then subtracting a large positive constant, BIG. BIG is
    ** chosen so that the low order fraction bits of z are discarded due to
    ** the alignment shift leaving only the integer and high fraction bits.
    ** Specifically:
    **
    **		BIG <-- 3*2^(B_PRECISION - k - 2)
    **		u   <-- BIG + z
    **		fm  <-- u - BIG
    **
    ** Note that if B_PRECISION > 32 and the rounding mode is round to nearest,
    ** then the low order 32 bits of t are the twos complement representation
    ** m and fm = u/2^k.
    **
    **
    ** Polynomial Generation For 2^x, e^x and 10^x:
    ** --------------------------------------------
    **
    ** The coefficients for 2^x are based on the Taylor series expansion
    ** for e^x:
    **
    **          e^x  = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ....
    **
    ** with the variable x replaced by x = z * ln2:
    **
    **          2^z = 1 + ln2*z + z^2*(ln2)^2/2! + z^3*(ln2)^3/3! + ....
    **              = 1 + z*(ln2 + z*(ln2)^2/2! + z^2*(ln2)^3/3! + ....)
    **              = 1 + z*P(z)

    ** CONSTANTS FOR FAST EXP
    ** ----------------------
    **
    ** In fast exp, we use the identity e^x = 2^(x/ln2).  Since we would like
    ** to delay the screening for overflow and underflow for as long as
    ** possible (to increase parallelism) and since x/ln2 might overflow,
    ** we perform the initial calculation as:
    **
    **		w  <-- x*[ 1/(2^n*ln2) ]
    **		t  <-- BIG/2^n + w
    **		fm <-- t - BIG/2^n
    **		z  <-- w - fm
    **
    ** This produces a reduced argument, z, "scaled down" by 2^n.  We can
    ** compensate for the scale factor in z by adjusting the coefficients
    ** in the polynomial evaluation.
    **
    ** Note that if backup precision is not available, the compuation of
    ** z is more complicated that inidicate.  Specificly, we must compute
    ** w = x*[ 1/(2^n*ln2) ] to extra precision by break x and 1/(2^n*ln2)
    ** into high and low pieces.
    **
    ** Other than requiring that n >= 1, the exact choice of n in the above
    ** discussion is arbitrary.  We choose n = F_EXP_WIDTH because, we can

    ** CONSTANTS FOR 2^x EVALUATION IN FAST POW
    ** ----------------------------------------
    **
    ** In fast pow, we use the identity x^y = 2^(y*log2(x)).  As in fast exp,
    ** we would like to delay the screening for overflow and underflow for as
    ** long as possible but we need to avoid overflow when computing the
    ** product y*log2(x).  To do this, we scale y down by an appropriate
    ** power of 2 prior to performing the multiplication.  Since
    **
    **	   2^(F_MIN_BIN_EXP - F_PRECISION + 1) <= x < 2^F_MAX_BIN_EXP
    **
    ** It follows that 
    **
    **  (F_MIN_BIN_EXP - F_PRECISION + 1)*ln2 <= log2(x) < F_MAX_BIN_EXP*ln2
    **
    ** On the platforms currently supportted:
    **
    **	 2^F_EXP_WIDTH > | F_MIN_BIN_EXP-F_PRECISION+1 | >= | F_MAX_BIN_EXP |
    **
    ** So that log2(x) < 2^F_EXP_WIDTH.  Therefore, the product
    ** (y * 2^-F_EXP_WIDTH)*log2(x) is guarenteed not to overflow.  Note that
    ** (y * 2^-F_EXP_WIDTH) might underflow.  But in this case the correct
    ** result of x^y is 1 to machine precision.  So even if underflow occurs
    ** the correct result we be returned.
    **
    ** For fast pow, we delay any overflow underflow checks until just before
    ** the evaluation of exponential polynomial.  At that point we perform
    ** a gross level check on x and y to sceen out all guarenteed exceptions.

    ** GENERAL DISCUSSION OF x^y AND log2(x)
    ** -------------------------------------
    **
    ** This implementation computes the power x^y in three conceptual stages:
    **   
    **     o  compute log2(x), with some extra bits of precision
    **     o  multiply  y * log2(x), maintaining the extra precision
    **     o  evaluate 2 ^ product.
    **
    ** In the actual implementations, the first two steps are combined.
    **
    **
    ** DEFINING THE TABLE SIZES:
    ** -------------------------
    **
    ** The evaluation of log2(x) and 2^product both use table look-up schemes
    ** to increase accuracy and performance.  The number of extra bits of
    ** precision required for log2(x) is F_EXP_WIDTH - 1 + POW2_K, where
    ** 2^POW2_K is the number of entries in the 2^x table (See the previous
    ** discussion on 2^x).
    **
    ** The total amount of extra precision in the log2(x) computation is a
    ** function of the log2 table size and the argument reduction scheme used.
    ** By way of explaination, consider calculating log2(f) for f in the
    ** interval [1,2).  Let the table size for the log2 evaluation be 2^LOG2_K
    ** and let j the integer such that Fj = 1 + j/2^LOG2_K is closest to f. 
    ** With the above definitions, we consider two possible argument reduction
    ** schemes:
    **
    **	With  :     z = (f - Fj)/(f + Fj)
    **	divide:	    log2(f) = log2(Fj) + (2/ln2)*[z + z^3/3 + z^5/5 + ...]
    **		 
    **	Without:    w = (f - Fj)/Fj
    **   divide:    log2(f) = log2(Fj) + (1/ln2)*[w - w^2/2 + w^3/3 - ... ]
    **		
    ** The worst case senario for accuracy is when f = 1 + 1/2^(LOG2_K + 1).
    ** This implies that log2(Fj) = 0 and that we can only get extended
    ** precision in the log2 computation by computing the first "few" terms
    ** of the series in extended precision.
    **
    ** In the "with divide" case, we compute z in extended precision, and the
    ** amount of extra precision in the final result is (essentially) the
    ** alignment shift between z and z^3/3, or 2*LOG2_K + 5.
    **
    ** In the "without divide" case, we compute s = w - w^2/2 in extended
    ** precision,  and the amount of extra precision in the final result is
    ** (essentially) the alignment shift between s and w^3/3, or 2*LOG2_K + 3.
    **
    ** If we are only considering accuracy, then we should chose LOG2_K and
    ** POW2_K according to the relationship:
    **
    **		2*LOG2_K + R = F_EXP_WIDTH - 1 + POW2_K
    **
    ** where R is 5 or 3 depending on whether the argument reduction is uses a
    ** divide or not.  However, since the power table is used for fast exp and
    ** regular exp (and possibly log2 and fast log2) the values of LOG2_K and
    ** POW2_K may be taken to be bigger than those prescribed by the above
    ** relation to increase the performance of any or all of the routines
    ** dependent upon the table.  In particular, the default values of LOG2_K
    ** and POW2_K do not satify the above relationship, but were chosen to
    ** optimize the performance of fast exp and fast pow.
    **
    **
    ** COMPUTATION OF LOG2(x)
    ** ----------------------
    **
    ** The computation of log2(x) proceeds as follows:
    **
    **		log2(2^I*f) = I + log2(f)
    **		            = I + log2(Fj) + log2(f/Fj)
    **			    = I + log2(Fj) + p(z)
    **
    ** where f is in [1, 2 ), Fj = 1 + j/2^LOG2_K and z is the "reduced"
    ** argument (using one of the two methods described above) and p is
    ** is a polynomial.  The form of p depends on the reduction methods.
    **
    ** 		NOTE: A more detailed discussion of the follow
    **		two sections is contained in dpml_pow.c
    **
    ** 
    ** Reduction With Divides:
    ** -----------------------
    **
    ** If the argument reduction for log2(x) is going to use a divide, then
    ** we need to compute z = [(f - Fj)/(f + Fj)]*(2/ln2) and p(z) is evaluated
    ** as:
    **
    **		p(z) = z + z^3*q(z^2)
    **
    ** where
    **
    **	    q(t) = (ln2/2)^2 * sum{ [t*(ln2/2)^2]^n/(2n+3) | n = 0, 1, ... }
    **
    ** It is necessary to compute z extra precision.  If no backup precision
    ** is available, then z must be computed in hi and lo pieces in order to
    ** obtain required accuracy for log2(x).  In this case the computation
    ** proceeds as follows:
    **
    **		t    = f - Fj
    **		s    = (f + Fj)
    **		r    = 1/s
    **		z    = t*r
    **		z_hi = hi_bits(z)
    **		f_hi = hi_bits(f)
    **		f_lo = lo_bits(f)
    ** 		z_lo = {([(f_hi - Fj)*hi_bits(2/ln2) - z_hi*s] +
    **		          f_lo*hi_bits(2/ln2)) +
    **		             [t*lo_bits(2/ln2) - z_hi*f_lo]}*g;
    **
    **
    ** Reduction Without Divides:
    ** --------------------------
    **
    ** If the argument reduction for log2(x) is not going to use a divide, then
    ** we need to compute z = (f - Fj)/(Fj*ln2) and p(z) is evaluated
    ** as:
    **
    **		p(z) = z - z^2*ln2/2 + z^3*q(z)
    **
    ** where
    **
    **	    q(t) = -(ln2)^2 * sum{ [-t*ln2]^n/(n+3) | n = 0, 1, ... }
    **
    ** It is necessary to compute s = z - z^2*ln2/2 to extra precision.  If no
    ** backup precision is available, then s must be computed in hi and lo
    ** pieces in order to obtain required accuracy for log2(x).  In this case
    ** the computation proceeds as follows:
    **
    **		t    = f - Fj
    **		z    = t*(1/(Fj*ln2))
    **		g    = Fj*Fj*(ln2/2)
    **		u    = 2*Fj
    **		s    = (u - t)*t*g
    **		s_hi = hi_bits(s)
    **		v    = Fj*s_hi
    **		t_hi = hi_bits(t)
    **		t_lo = lo_bits(t)
    **          s_lo = {[u*(t - v*hi_bits(ln2)) + t_hi^2] +
    **                     [t_lo*(t + t_hi) - u*v*lo_bits(ln2))]}*g
    **
    ** For the fast pow routine, we use the "no divide" reduction.  However,
    ** we "cheat" on the accuracy of final result by computing the polynomial
    ** as
    **		p(z) = z_hi + z_lo  - z*q(z)
    **
    ** where
    **
    **	    q(t) = ln2 * sum{ [-t*ln2]^n/(n+2) | n = 0, 1, ... }
