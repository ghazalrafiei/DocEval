**  Design Overview:
**  ---------------
**
**  The implementation of expm1 is based on the implementation of exp(x).
**  Specifically, exp is computed as follows:
**
**	o Let fm be the value of x/ln2 rounded to POW2_K bits, where POW2_K
**	  is a small positive integer value.
**	o Let I and j be the integer and fraction bits of fm and z = x - ln2*fm
**
**  Then
**
**		e^x = 2^(I + j/2^POW2_K)*e^z
**		    = 2^I * 2^(j/2^POW2_K) * [1 + z*p(z)]
**
**  where p(z) is a polynomial approximation to (e^x - 1)/x.  The value of
**  2^(j/2^POW2_K) is obtained from a table in hi and lo pieces: T(j) the
**  correctly rounded value of 2^(j/2^POW2_K) and R(j) =
**  [2^(j/2^POW2_K) - T(j)]/T(j).  Then
**
**		e^x = 2^I * [ T(j) + T(j)* R(j)] * [ 1 + z*p(z) ]
**		    = 2^I * T(j) * [ 1 + R(j)] * [ 1 + z*p(z) ]
**		    = 2^I * T(j) * [ 1 + R(j) + z*p(z) + R(j)*z*p(z) ]
**
**  If we denote by V(I,j) the product 2^I*T(j) we have
**
**		e^x = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*{ R(j) + [1 + R(j)]*z*p(z) }
**
**  Note that V(I,j) is exact and there is an alignment shift of at least
**  POW2_K + 1 bits between V(I,j) and V(I,j)*{ R(j) + [1 + R(j)]*z*p(z) },
**  there by allowing for a very accurate final result.
**
**  Based on the above, e^x - 1 is simply
**
**	expm1(x) = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*{ R(j) + [1 + R(j)]*z*p(z) } - 1.	(1)
**
**  Note that the polynomial p(z) has the form p(z) = 1 + z*q(z).  If we
**  define U(j,z) = R(j)*(1 + z) + z^2*q(z) and W(j,z) = U(j,z) + z, then
**
**	expm1(x) = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*{ R(j) + [1 + R(j)]*z*p(z) } - 1
**	         = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*{ R(j) + [1 + R(j)]*z*[1 + z*q(z)] } - 1
**	         = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*{ R(j) + [1 + R(j)]*z*[1 + z*q(z)] } - 1
**	         = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*{ R(j)*(1 + z) + z^2*q(z) + z +
**                     R(j)*z^2*q(z) } - 1
**	         = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*{ U(j,z) + z + R(j)*z^2*q(z) } - 1
**	         = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*{ W(j,z) + R(j)*z^2*q(z) } - 1.
**
**  Finally, we note that for machine precision arithmetic, the term
**  R(j)*z^2*q(z) is insignificant relative to W(j,z) so that
**
**		expm1(x) = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*W(j,z)) - 1			(2)
**
**  The trick in evaluating (2) is determining where to add the -1 term so
**  that no accuracy is lost.  The tack chosen in this routine is to divide
**  the domain of expm1 into several subdomains based on the value of I.
**
**	NOTE: When backup precision is available, only one of the subdomains,
** 	the polynomial range need be implemented.
**
**
**  Constant Range:
**
**	If I < -(F_PRECISION + 1), all of the terms except -1 are insignificant
**	in the current precision, so just return -1
**
**  Hi/lo Range:
**
**	If -(F_PRECISION + 1) <= I <= -2,  -1 is the dominate term, but
**	the sum V(I,j) - 1 will lose some precision.  In this case, we
**	break V(I,j) - 1 into hi and lo pieces as follows:
**
**		hi = V(I,j) - 1
**		lo = V(I,j) - (hi + 1)
**
**	and then write (2) as
**
**		expm1(x) = hi + [ lo + V(I,j)*W(j,z)]
**
**  Problem Range:
**
**	When I = 0 or -1, V(I,j) is very close to 1, so that V(I,j) - 1 can be
**	very small (zero in fact), which effectively eliminates the alignment
**	shift required to maintain accuracy.  In this case, we need to reorder
**	the sum in (1) in order to restore the original overhang.  Recalling
**	that W(j,z) = U(j,z) + z, and denoting V(I,j) - 1 by V1(I,j),
**
**		expm1(x) = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*W(j,z) - 1
**		         = [V(I,j) - 1] + V(I,j)*[ U(j,z) + z ]
**		         = V1(I,j) + [ V1(I,j) + 1 ]*[ U(j,z) + z ]
**		         = V1(I,j) + U(j,z) + z + V1(I,j)*[ U(j,z) + z ]
**		         = V1(I,j) + z + U(j,z) + V1(I,j)*W(j,z)
**
**	Now, suppose that z, the reduced argument is computed in hi and lo
**	pieces.  Then the above equation becomes:
**
**		expm1(x) = V1(I,j) + z + U(j,z) + V1(I,j)*W(j,z)
**		         = [V1(I,j) + z_hi] + [z_lo + U(j,z) + V1(I,j)*W(j,z)]
**
**	Note that [ V1(I,j) + z_hi ]/[ z_lo + U(j,z) + V1(I,j)*W(j,z) ] ~
**	[ V1(I,j) + z ]/[ z^2/2 + V1(I,j)*z ] so that the first term overhangs
**	the second by at least POW2_K bits.  With all of the above in mind, the
**	final calculation looks like:
**
**		hi = V1(I,j) + z_hi
**		lo = (z_hi - (hi - V1(I,j))) + z_lo
**		expm1(x) =  hi + { lo + [ U(j,z) + V1(I,j)*W(j,z) ] }
**
**  Normal Range:
**
**	When 1 <= I <= F_PRECISION - 1, V(I,j) - 1 is exact and loses at most
**	one bit of alignment shift.  In this case we can compute expm1 as
**
**		expm1(x) = [V(I,j) - 1] + V(I,j)*W(j,z)
**
**  Big range:
**
**	When F_PRECISION <= I, then 1 is insignificant relative to V(I,j).
**	In this case we can compute expm1 as
**
**		expm1(x) = V(I,j) + [ V(I,j)*W(j,z) - 1 ]
**
**	Note that on this range, overflow might occur.
**
**  Polynomial Range:
**
**	When |x| is relatively small, then I and j are both zero and no
**	alignment shift is available using (2).  In this situation, we
**	base are approximation on the Taylor series expansion:
**
**		expm1(x) = sum { x^n/n! | n = 1, ... }
