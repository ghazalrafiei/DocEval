**  Design Overview:
**  ---------------
**
**  Given x and a positive integer POW2_K, for b = 2, e or 10 define:
**
**	t = x * (lnb/ln2)
**	m = nint(t * (2^POW2_K))/2^POW2_K			(1)
**      z = x - m ( ln2/lnb)
**      w = t - m
**
**  Then
**
**	e^x = 2^(x*(lnb/ln2))
**	    = 2^(m + w)
**	    = 2^m * 2^w						(2)
**	    = 2^m * e^z						(3)
**
**  From the definition of m, it follows that m can be re-written as
**
**          m  =  I + j/(2^POW2_K)
**
**  where I and j are integers and 0 <= j <= 2^POW2_K - 1. It follows that (3)
**  can be written as:
**
**      e^x = 2^(I + j/(2^POW2_K)) * e^z
**          = 2^I * 2^(j/(2^POW2_K)) * e^z			(4)
**
**  Now e^z can be approximated by a polynomial of the form:
**
**      e^z = 1 + z*p(z)
**
**  So that (4) can be rewritten as:
**
**      e^x = 2^I  *  2^(j/(2^POW2_K))*(1 + z*p(z))		(5)
**
**  Design Details:
**  --------------
**
**	o The multiplication by 2^I can be accomplished by adding I to the
**        exponent field of a binary floating point number or creating  an
**        appropriate floating point value and multiplying.
**
**	o There are exactly 2^(POW2_K) possible values represented by
**        2^(j/(2^POW2_K)).   These  can  be stored in a table and looked up
**        at run time using the bit sequence in 'j' as an index.  The form of
**	  the table values (hi and lo pieces) is determined by efficiency
**	  considerations for fast pow and exp, although the performance
**	  impact on exp is minimal: one floating point add, if sequential
**	  polynomial evaluation is used; none if parallel evaluation is used.
**

** IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
** ----------------------
**
** In general, extra precision is required at two key points in the algorithm:
** the argument reduction (computing z or w), and the scaling by 2^(j/2^POW2_K).
** On systems where no backup precision is available, these calculations are
** performed in hi and lo pieces to preserve the overall accuracy of the final
** result.
**
** Let T(j) =  2^(j/2^POW2_K) correctly rounded to F_PRECISION and define
** R(j) = [2^(j/2^POW2_K) - T(j)]/T(j).  We assume that these values are
** precomputed and stored in a table.
**
** 
**    Data Types With No Backup
**    -------------------------
**
**	Compute the reduced argument, z = x - m*(ln2/lnb), carefully, using
**	ln2 in hi and lo pieces:
**
**              z <-- [ x - m*hi_bits(ln2/lnb) ] - m*lo_bits(ln2/lnb)
** 
**	Perform the evaluation as:
**
**		e^x = 2^I * 2^(j/(2^POW2_K)) * [ 1 + z*p(z) ]
**		    = 2^I * [ T(j) + T(j)*R(j) ] * [ 1 + z*p(z) ]
**		    = 2^I * T(j) * [ 1 + R(j) ] * [ 1 + z*p(z) ]
**		    = [ 2^I * T(j) ] * [ 1 + R(j) + z*p(z) + R(j)*z*p(z) ]
**
**	Denote 2^I*T(j) as V(I,j) and note that the last term is insignificant
**	relative to the final result, then we have:
**
**		e^x = [ 2^I * T(j) ] * [ 1 + R(j) + z*p(z) + R(j)*z*p(z) ]
**		    = V(I,j) * { 1 + [ R(j) + z*p(z) ] }
**		    = V(I,j) + V(I,j)*[ R(j) + z*p(z) ]
**
**    Data Types With Backup
**    ----------------------
**
**	Compute all intermediate results in backup precision:
**
**		w <-- (x/ln2) - m
**
**		e^x = 2^I * 2^(j/(2^POW2_K)) * 2^w
**		    = 2^I * T(j) * [1 + w*q(w)]
**		    = V(I,j) * Q(w)
**
** where V(I,j) is as above.

        ** The product x*(1/ln2) is on the critical path of this routine.
