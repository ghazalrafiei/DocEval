** The DPML can potentially support 6 different types of power functions with
** a floating point base and a integer power.  Six types are determined by
** whether the integer power is a signed or unsigned integer and whether 0^0
** retun 0, 1 or an error.  The following note discusses a common subroutine,
** __powil, that supports all 6 types of powi functions.
** 
** 
** 1.0 BASIC DESIGN AND INTERFACE
** ------------------------------
** 
** The basic approach to __powil to to encode the behavior of the 0^0 case in
** the class-to-action mapping array.   Specifically, if we denote the exponent
** as n, we create a class-to-action mapping array that has mappings for n < 0,
** n > 0 (both even and odd cases) and three entries for n = 0.  The three
** entries for n = 0 correspond to the three choices for 0^0.
**
** For each of the six possible powi routines, we define an integer, call it
** index_map, consisting of 3, k-bit fields.  The first field contains the
** index into the class-to-action mapping table for n < 0; the second for n = 0;
** and the third for n > 0.  Note that the unsigned integer case is handled by
** making the first and third field of index_map identical.
** 
** The actual algorithm for __powil is fairly simple - it uses the standard
** iterative "square and multiply" approach.  The only difference from the basic
** DPML implementation is that for negative exponents, the reciprocal of the
** argument is used for the iterations rather than performing the reciprocal
** after the iterations.
** 
** It should be pointed out, that this will most likely mean the __powil routine
** will be slightly *SLOWER* than the existing DPML routines for the
** non-exceptional cases.  We might want to consider expanding the MULTIPLY and
** SQUARE operations in-line to improve performance.  The resulting code
** expansion should not be too great (i.e. less that 10%).

    ** Get correct index for class-to-action array.  The next line computes
    ** index according to the following table:
    **
    **		     n		index
    **		---------	-----
    **		zero		  0
    **		pos, even	  1
    **		pos, odd	  2
    **		neg, even	  3
    **		neg, odd	  4
    **
    ** the macro INDEX_MAP, needs to adhere to the above ordering and the
    ** class to action mappings for the odd cases must immediately follow
    ** the even cases.
