** BASIC ALGORITHM:
** ----------------
**
** Let z = x + octant*(pi/4).  We want to produce
**
**		y = rem( z, pi/2 )
**
** or equivalently,
**
**		Q = nint( z/(pi/2) )
**		y = z - Q*(pi/2)
**
** Note that the reduce argument is in "radians".  For computational
** purposes, it is convenient to first obtain the reduced argument in
** cycles - i.e. compute y as
**
**              c   = z/(pi/2)
**              Q   = nint(c)
**              w  = c - Q
**              y = w*(pi/2)
**
** If in the above calculations, we substitute x + octant*(pi/4) for x, we get
**
**              c   = x/(pi/2) + octant/2
**              Q   = nint(c)
**              w  = c - Q
**              y = w*(pi/2)
**
** Now, suppose instead of computing, c, Q and w, we compute c' = 2*c, Q' = 2*Q
** and w' = 2*w.  Then the above becomes
**
**              c' = x/(pi/4) + octant
**              Q' = 2*nint(c'/2)
**              w'  = x/(pi/4) + octant - Q'
**              y = w'*(pi/4)
**
** We see that the key operation is to compute x/(pi/4).  With this in mind,
** let x = 2^n*f, where 1/2 <= f < 1 and f has P' ( = 128 ) significant bits.
** If F is defined as F = 2^P'*f, it follows that F is an integer.
** Now
**
**              x/(pi/4) = x*(4/pi)
**                       = (2^n*f)*(4/pi)
**                       = [2^(n-P')]*[2^P'*f] *(4/pi)
**                       = [2^(n-P')]*F*(4/pi)
**                       = F*{2^(n-P')*(4/pi)}
**
** Suppose that we have stored a large bit string that represents the value
** of 4/pi, then we can obtain the value of 2^(n-P')*(4/pi) by moving the
** binary point in 4/pi by n-P' places.  In particular, let
**
**              2^(n-P')*(4/pi) = J*8 + g
**
** That is, J is an integer formed from the first n-P'-3 bits of 4/pi and
** g is value formed by the remaining bits.  It follows that 
**
**              x/(pi/4) = F*{2^(n-P')*(4/pi)}
**                       = F*(J*8 + g)
**                       = F*J*8 + F*g
**
** Note that we need only compute x/(pi/4) modulo 8.  Since F and J are both
** integers, the above gives
**
**              x/(pi/4) (mod 8) = (F*J*8 + F*g) (mod 8)
**                               = F*g (mod 8)
**
** At this point the algorithm for large argument reduction has the following
** flavor:
**
**              (1) index into a precomputed bit string for 4/pi to
**                  obtain g 
**              (2) compute w = F*g (mod 8)
**              (3) w <-- integer part of w + octant (mod 8)
**              (4) Q <-- nint(w)
**              (5) y = w - Q
**              (6) y = y*(pi/4)
**
**			Algorithm I
**			-----------
**
** The following sections describe the implementation issues associated with
** each of the steps in algorithm I as well as present the code for the 
** overall implementation.
**
**
** THE 4/pi TABLE
** --------------
**
** Step (1) of Algorithm I requires indexing into a bit string for 4/pi using
** the exponent field of the argument.  Specifically, if n is the argument
** exponent we want to shift the binary point of 4/pi by n - P' bits to the
** right.  If |x| < pi/4, there is no need to compute x/(pi/4), so we assume
** that we only index into the table if |x| >= 1/2.  Under this assumption,
** it is possible that n - P' is negative.  Thus to facilitate the indexing
** operation, it is necessary for the bit string to have some leading 0's.
**
** Assume the bit string for 4/pi has T leading zeros and that the bits are
** numbered in increasing order starting from 0.  I.e. the string looks like:
**
**	bit number: 0      T
**	            00...001.01000101111.....
**                          ^
**                          |
**		       binary point 
**
** From the above discussion, we want to shift the binary point of the bit
** string n-P' bits to the right and extract g as some (as yet undetermined)
** number of bits, starting 3 bits to the left of the shifted binary point.
** Consequently, the position of the most significant bit we would like to
** access is k = T + n - P' - 2.  Since we want the bit position to be greater
** than or equal to zero, and we are assuming that the argument is greater
** than or equal to 1/2 (i.e. n >= 0), it follows that T >= P' + 2.
','line_number':65,'multiline':True]['text':'
** Since most architectures do not efficiently support bit addressing, the
** argument reduction routine assumes that the 4/pi bit string is stored
** in L-bit "digits".  Getting the right bits of 4/pi requires getting the set
** of "digits" that begin with the digit that contains the leading bit and
** doing a sequence of shifts and logical ors.  The index of the digit that
** contains the initial bit is trunc(n/L) and the bit position within that
** digit is n - L*trunc(n/L) = n % L.  For the unpacked reduction routine,
** we require the 4/pi table "digit" and a UX_FRACTION_DIGIT have the same
** length (which implies the digit length is either 32 or 64 bits).

    ** COMPUTING F*g
    ** -------------
    **
    ** The goal of step (2) in Algorithm I is to produce a reduced argument
    ** that is accurate to P + k bits, where k is the specified number of
    ** extra bits of precision. Also, we need to get the quadrant bits, Q.
    ** Consequently, the value of w = F*g, must be accurately computed to
    ** P + k + 3 bits.  Note however, that if x is close to a multiple of
    ** pi/2 the reduced argument will have a large number of leading zeros
    ** (in fixed point) and consequently the actual number of required bits
    ** in w will depend upon the input argument.  Since computing w is the
    ** most time consuming part of the algorithm, we would like to compute
    ** the minimum number of bits possible.  Specifically, compute w to enough
    ** bits so that if x is not near a multiple of pi/2, then the reduced
    ** argument will be accurate.  After w is computed, we can check how close
    ** the original argument was to pi/2 by examining the number of leading
    ** fractional 1's or 0's in w.  If there are too many (i.e. the reduced
    ** argument will not have enough significant bits) then we can compute
    ** additional bits of w.
    **
    ** In order to compute F*g to P + k + 3 bits, we must perform some form of 
    ** extended precision arithmetic.  For the sake of uniformity across data
    ** types and architectures, the implementation described here computes F*g
    ** by expressing F and g as fixed point values in "arrays" of some basic
    ** integer unit of computation.  As indicated above, we shall refer to this
    ** integer unit as a digit.  The choice of digit is arbitrary, however, it
    ** is best if the double length product of two digits is efficiently
    ** computed.
    **
    ** Now we need to represent w to at least P + k + 3 bits.  Since F has P'
    ** significant bits, if we use a finite precision approximation of g, call
    ** it g', then the last P' bits of the product F*g' are inaccurate.
    ** Therefore we need to represent g' to N = P' + P + k + 3 bits.   If the
    ** number of bits in a digit is L, then F and g' must be represented in at
    ** least ceil(P'/L) and D = ceil(N/L) digits respectively.
    ','line_number':238,'multiline':True]['text':'
    ** Now consider the computation of F*g' in terms of digits.  For the
    ** purpose of discussion, suppose F requires 2 digits and g' requires 4
    ** digits.
    ** Then using "black board" arithmetic F*g' looks like:

    **
    ** The high two digits of the product are not required since we are
    ** interested in the result modulo 8.
    **
    ** In general the number of digits used to express g' will contain more
    ** than N bits.  Let the number of bits in excess of N be M.  Then if x is
    ** close to pi/2 and the number of leading fractional 0's or 1's in F*g' is
    ** less than M, F*g' still contains enough significant bits to return an
    ** accurate reduced argument.  If we denote the 3 most significant bits
    ** of w1 as o, then x will be close to pi/2 if o is odd the bits below
    ** o are 1's or o is even and the bits below o are 0's.  Therefore there
    ** will be loss of significance if w1 (in the picture above) has a binary
    ** representation of the form
    **
    **                      +----------------------+
    **                      |xx00000...00000xxxxxxx|
    **                      +----------------------+
    **                              - or -
    **                      +----------------------+
    **                      |xx11111...11111xxxxxxx|
    **                      +----------------------+
    **                         |<-- M+2 -->|
    **
    ** These two bit patterns can be detected by add and mask operations.
    **
    ** Assuming that M+2 0's or 1's appear in w1, we know that there are not
    ** enough significant bits in w to guarantee the accuracy of the answer.
    ** Consequently, we need to generate more bits of w.  This can be done by
    ** getting the next digit of g, computing the product of that digit with
    ** F and adding it into the previous value of w.  This process can be
    ** repeated until there are a sufficient number of significant bits.  Note
    ** that each additional digit of g will add one digit (L bits) of
    ** significance to w.
    **
    ** If the processes of adding additional significant bits is implemented
    ** in a naive fashion, each time through the loop will require an
    ** additional digit of storage.  Consider the situation where the first
    ** additional digit has been added to w and there are still insufficient
    ** significant bits for an accurate result.  This means that there are at
    ** least M + L leading fractional 0's or 1's.  Then w must have the form
    **
    **              |<------------ D + 1 digits ---------->|
    **              +----------+----------+     +----------+

    **              +----------+----------+     +----------+
    **                 |<-- M+L+2 -->|
    **
    ** where the #'s indicate a string of 0's or 1's.  Since there are more
    ** than L consecutive 0's or 1's, we can compress the representation of w
    ** by one digit by removing L consecutive 0's or 1's from the first two
    ** digits of w.  If this is done w will look like
    **
    **              |<-------------- D digits ------------>|
    **              +----------+----------+     +----------+

    **              +----------+----------+     +----------+
    **              -->|M+2|<--
    **
    ** Which is the same as for when the first additional digit was added.
    ** It follows that we need storage for only D+1 digits of w and a counter
    ** indicating the number of additional digits that were added.
    **
    ** To recap the above discussion, algorithm I is expanded as follows:
    **
    **               (1) s <-- 0
    **               (2) w <-- first D digits of F*g
    **               (3) if w has less than or equal to M leading fractional
    **                   0's or 1's, go to step 9
    **               (4) add an additional digit of F*g to w
    **               (5) if w has less than L leading leading fractional 0's
    **                   or 1's, go to step 9
    **               (6) Compact w by removing L 0's or 1's
    **               (7) s <-- s + 1
    **               (8) go to step 3.
    **               (9) o <-- high three bits of w
    **              (10) z' <-- w - nint(w) (taking into account what
    **		            ever compaction took place, i.e. what the current
    **			    value of s is.)
    **              (11) y = z*(pi/4)
    **		
    **				Algorithm II
    **				------------
    **
    ** The above loop has two exits.  An exit from step 3 yields an
    ** approximation to w containing D digits while an exit from step 5
    ** contains D+1 digits.  In the second case, there are fewer than L
    ** leading 0's and 1's and this implies that there are enough "good" bits
    ** in the first D digits to generate the return values.  Consequently,
    ** from either exit, it is sufficient to use only the first D digits of w.
    **
    ** The exposition above on the number of leading zeros was a little loose,
    ** in that for the general case, the leading zeros and ones may not always
    ** lie entirely in the first digit of w.  In general, there can be as many
    ** as L-1 extra bits, in which case, we would need to examine both the
    ** first and second word of w. However, for the digit sizes we are
    ** considering combined with the number of extra bits we are returning,
    ** examining one digit will suffice.

    ** DIGIT ARITHMETIC
    ** ----------------
    **
    ** In step (2) of Algorithm 2, we are computing the first D digits of the
    ** product F*g.  From figure 1, we see that, (in general) we are computing
    ** a 2*L bit product and incorporating it into the sum of previously
    ** computed 2*L bit products.  If we think of F, g and w as multi-digit
    ** integers with their digits numbered from least significant to most
    ** significant (starting at zero) and denoting the i-th digit of F by F(i)
    ** and the j-th digit of g by g(j), then the product in figure 1 can be
    ** obtained as follows:
    **
    **		t = 0;
    **		for (i = 0; i < num_g_digits; i++)
    **		    {

    ** The above gives rise to the notion of a multiply/add primitive that has 5
    ** inputs and 3 output: 
    **
    **	Inputs:		N, M	the most and least significant digits
    **				of t that are being added to
    **			C	the carry out from the previous mul/add
    **			A, B	The two digits that are to be multiplied
    **
    **	Outputs:	C'	The carry out of the final sum
    **			N',M'	The updated values of N and M.
    **
    ** Recalling that the number of bits per digit is denoted by L, the mul/add
    ** primitive is algebraicly defined by:
    **
    **		s  <-- (N + C)*2^L + A*B
    **		M' <-- s % 2^L
    **		N' <-- floor(s/2^L) % 2^L
    **		C' <-- floor(s/2^(2*L)) % 2^L
    **
    ** Note that in example 1, there are several special cases of the mul/add
    ** macro which might be faster depending on the values of i and j:
    **
    **	   i and j			Special case
    **	------------------	---------------------------------
    **	1) i = 0, j = 0		N = M = C = 0, C' = 0
    **	2) i = 0, j < n-1	N = C = 0, C' = 0
    **	3) i = 0, j = n-1	N = C = 0, C' = 0 and N' not needed
    **
    **	4) i > 0, j = 0		C = 0	
    **	5) i > 0, j < n-1	general case
    **	6) i > 0, j = n-1	N = 0, C' not needed
    **
    **	7) i + j = n-2		C' not needed
    **	8) i + j = n-1		C, N, C' and N' not needed
    **		
    ** Note that cases 3 and 7 are functionally identical.  For purposes of
    ** this discussion we will use the mnemonic XMUL to refer to producing a
    ** 2*L-bit product from 2 L-bit digits and XADD/XADDC to refer to the
    ** addition of one 2*L-bit integer to another without/with producing a
    ** carry out.  With this naming convention we denote the following 6
    ** mul/add operations that correspond to the 6 special cases as follows:
    **
    **	case	mul/add operator name
    **	----	---------------------
    **	 1)	 XMUL(A,B, N',M')
    **	 2)	 XMUL_ADD(A,B,M,N',M')
    **	 3)	 MUL_ADD(A,B,M,M')
    **	 4)	 XMUL_XADDC(A,B,N,M,C',N',M')
    **	 5)	 XMUL_XADDC_W_C_IN(C,A,B,N,M,C',N',M')
    **	 6)	 XMUL_XADD_W_C_IN(N,M,C,A,B,C',N',M')
    **
    ** [XMUL_XADD_W_C_IN is described with more parameters than are actually
    **  used.]
    ** [There are 8 cases, two of which are "functionally identical".  That
    ** leaves 7 cases, but only 6 have a "mul/add operator name".]
