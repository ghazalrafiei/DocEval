*****************************************************************************','line_number':1,'multiline':True]['text':' This file contains definitions that are related to floating formats.

We assume that the floating point number represention is based on the
fact that every non-zero real number, x, can be uniquely represented as

    x = (-1)^s * f * 2^e    where  2^NORM <= f < 2^(NORM + 1)

We also assume that the bit representation of floating point numbers is
divided into three disjoint fields defined by the following mnemonics:

      NAME        WIDTH      START POSITION    CONTIGUOUS?
    --------      -----      --------------    -----------
    Sign bit        1         SIGN_BIT_POS         Yes
    Exponent    EXP_WIDTH       EXP_POS            Yes
    Mantissa  PRECISION - 1     LSB_POS        Not for VAX

Ignoring denormalized numbers, NANs and infinities, the values of these
fields are defined as follows:

    Sign bit:   = 0 if x >= 0 
                = 1 if x < 0

    Exponent:   = 0 if x = 0 
                = (e + EXP_BIAS) otherwise

    Mantissa:   = 0 if x = 0 
                = rnd(f) - 2^NORM otherwise
                (rnd(f) is f limited to PRECISION bits)
