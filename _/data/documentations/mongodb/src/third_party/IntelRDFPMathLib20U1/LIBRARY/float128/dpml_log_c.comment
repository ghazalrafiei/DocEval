 * SUMMARY OF THE ALGORITHM
 *
 *  The algorithm uses a large table for argument reduction, and then
 *  polynomial approximation.  Certain aspects of the algorithm were 
 *  suggested in an article by Peter Tang, in Transactions on Mathematical 
 *  Software, December 1990.
 *
 *  In general, log of x can be computed by first reducing x to a small range
 *  near 1, and computing the log of the reduced argument.  Write x = 2^m * f,
 *  where f is in the interval [1, 2], then  log(x) = m * log(2) + log(f).  
 *  Chop up the interval [1,2] into tiny subintervals [F(i), F(i+1)].  
 *  Determine which division point F(j) is closest to f; then  
 *     x = 2^m * f =  2^m *  F(j) * ( f/F(j) ),
 *  where the last factor is very close to 1.  Then 
 *     log(x) =  m * log(2) +  log(F(j)) +  log(f/F(j)) .
 *  Since w = f/F(j) is very close to 1, its log can be approximated with a 
 *  relatively small degree polynomial in w - 1 or (1-w)/(1+w)  (details in
 *  a following section).
 *
 *  When x is quite close to 1, however, the roundoff error in computing the
 *  variable w becomes visible, and can lead to quite large relative error.
 *  First, when x is very close to 1 (and, say x > 1), then m = 0 and F(j) = 1.
 *  The terms m * log(2) and log(F(j)) are both zero, so we need an accurate
 *  approximation for log(f/F(j)).  If x is a little farther from 1, so that
 *  j is a small positive integer, then m = 0 and F(j) is about 1 + j/2^LOG_K
 *  (depending on how F(j) is defined), and log(F(j)) is about j/2^LOG_K.
 *  The leading term of the polynomial in w can be as large as 1/2^(LOG_K + 1),
 *  which is not much smaller than log(F(j)) and possibly has opposite sign.
 *
 *  To finesse this problem, the current implementation of log uses a special
 *  path for x "near 1".  This approach is efficient because it permits a
 *  less stringent approximation for log(f/F(j)), provided that the cost
 *  of a branch is not too great.  An exception: the single precision fast
 *  logs use one path, because the error bound of the polynomial
 *  approximation for log(f/F(j)) is within the (relaxed) error requirements
 *  for fast functions.
 *
 * ONE PATH
 *  The accurate log functions have a ONE_PATH compile option (non-shared),
 *  which is appropriate in a situation that severely penalizes branching.
 *  In the ONE_PATH algorithm, the variable f/F(j) - 1 is computed very
 *  carefully in hi and lo parts, and the linear term of the polynomial
 *  is carefully split up into hi and lo parts and added to the respective
 *  hi and lo terms of the expression.  Unfortunately, the cost of this
 *  additional care has to be paid even when the care is not necessary,
 *  e.g. when x is large.
 *
 * TABLE CONSTANTS
 *  Both the ONE_PATH and the two path approaches store F(j), log(F(j)), 
 *  and 1/F(j) in a table, and index into the table using the leading
 *  LOG_K fraction bits of f.
 *
 *  In order to maintain the accuracy, computations use backup precision
 *  wherever possible.
 *  
 *  If no backup precision is available, log(F(j)) and (for the ONE_PATH
 *  algorithm) 1/F(j) are stored in the table in hi and lo parts.
 *  log(2) and, for base 2 and 10, log(e), are also given in hi and lo parts. 
 *  The hi part of log(2) is generated to have at least F_EXP_WIDTH trailing
 *  zero bits so that m * log(2) will be an exact product.  Similarly, 
 *  the hi part of log(F(j)) has enough trailing zeros so that
 *  when it is added to  m * log2_hi, no significant bits of log(F(j))_hi
 *  will be lost.  The lo parts of log(2) and log(F) are given in full 
 *  precision.  Any roundoff error generated in computations that involve 
 *  the lo parts will be shifted off.
 *
 *  All of these constants, the coefficients for the approximation polynomials,
 *  and the table of F(j) data are stored in the same array.
 *
 * LOG1P
 *  The computation of log1p(x) is similar to that for ln(x).  If x is not
 *  too close to zero, we compute ln(1+x) following Tang's recommendations
 *  to avoid roundoff error in the computation of (y - Fj)/Fj.  
 *  If x is within the interval [T1 - 1, T2 - 1], then x + 1 
 *  will be in the small interval [T1, T2] used in this implementation.  
 *  If x is really close to zero, return x.  The error cases are analogous 
 *  to those for natural log.
 *
 * POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATIONS
 *  There are two standard approaches for polynomial approximation for the
 *  natural log, ln(w), where w is close to 1.
 *  1.  Write f = y + F, then f/F = 1 + y/F = 1 + z.  Using the Taylor's 
 *   expansion,  
 *       log(1 + z)  =  z - z^2/2 + z^3/3 + ... + (-1)^(n+1) * z^n / n + ...
 *  This suggests the minmax polynomial will be of the form
 *     Q(z)  = z +  C1*z^2 + C2*z^3 + ....
 *  This implementation computes the variable z by taking 
 *    z = (f-F) * (1/F),  where the reciprocal 1/F is stored in the F table.
 *
 *  2.  Write  z = ((f/F) - 1)/( (f/F) + 1) =  (f - F)/(f + F).
 *   The approximation for log(1 + f/F) can be derived from the Taylor's
 *   expansion:
 *      log(1 + f/F) =  2z + 2* z^3/3  + 2* z^5/5 + ...
 *   The factor 2 can be absorbed into z, so that the final form of the
 *   polynomial is
 *      log(1 + f/F) =  z +  z^3/12  +  z^5/80 + ...
 *   This suggests that the minmax polynomial will be
 *      z +  z * (C1* (z^2) + C2* (z^2)^2  + ...  =   z + z*P(z^2).
 *  
 *  To achieve comparable accuracy, more terms are required in the first
 *  approach's polynomial (the "reciprocal" approach) than in the second
 *  (the "quotient" approach), but the second approach requires a division
 *  in computing the approximation variable.
 *
 *  In this implementation, both the "normal path" (x not near 1) and the
 *  "near 1" path can be computed either with the first or second approach.
 *  By default, both paths use the approximation that avoids the use of
 *  floating point division.  These defaults can be overridden with compile
 *  options:
 *      -U USE_RECIP         for the "normal path"
 *      -U NO_DIVISIONS      for the "near 1 path"
 *  These choices are independent of one another.  The choices could also
 *  be tied to architecture considerations, e.g. the relative instruction
 *  speeds of divisions, and adds and multiplies.  In any case, coefficients
 *  for both sets of polynomials are generated in the non-shared include files
 *  at build time.

 *
 *      IEEE format:

 *          x = +denormal  is scaled, and the log is computed.
 *          x = +0  returns -INFINITY, through the exception dispatcher.
 *          x negative (including x = -INFINITY and x = -0) returns a NaN
 *              through the exception dispatcher.
 *
 *  The fast routines raise a floating point overflow for error cases.

 *
 *    2.  each row contains F(j), 1/F(j), and logF(j) in hi and lo parts.

 *  This procedure generates T1 and T2 (the boundaries of the interval 
 *  "near 1") given as "integers" in the form  sign-expon-frac.
 *
 *  The values of T1 and T2 depend on LOG_K.  If x > 1 is very close to 1,
 *  say, m = 0, but j > 0, then
 *     log(x) = log(F(j))_hi + z + poly(z) + log(F(j))_lo
 *  where z = (x - F(j))* 1/F(j).  Although x - F(j) is exact, multiplying
 *  by 1/F causes a rounding error (3/2 lsb in the worst case).  log(F(j)) is
 *  approximately  j/2^LOG_K, and is given in extra precision.  If z is 
 *  computed only to working precision, then by forcing an alignment shift
 *  of at least 2 bits, the error in z is safely shifted off.  When using
 *  backup precision, a smaller alignment shift will work.
 *  The alignment shift used here is log2(SAFE_LIM) = 3  if no backup
 *  type exists, and an alignment shift of approximately 1 if there is 
 *  backup, leading to a max relative error of approx .56 lsb (double).  
 *  The smallest value of F(j) used is 1 + SAFE_LIM/2^LOG_K = T2, and 
 *  1 - SAFE_LIM/2^LOG_K for T1.  
 *
 *  In base 2 or 10, z is multiplied by log(e), which introduces an additional
