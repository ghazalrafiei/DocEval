** UX_EXP_REDUCE performs argument reduction for the exponential family of

** argument, z, and the scale factor, s, as:
**
**			lnb*x = s*ln2 + z,	|z| < ln2/2
**
** where b is equal to e or 10. If |x| > 2^16, UX_EXP_REDUCE returns a value of
** s and z that will force underflow or overflow in the pack routine.

    ** Given an input argument of the form x = 2^n*f, we want to compute
    ** lnb*x = scale*ln2 + z, |z| <= ln2/2.  Or equivalently, scale =
    ** nint(x*lnb/ln2) and z = scale*ln2.  Suppose, the number of bits in a
    ** fraction digit is k, and we define K = 2^k.  Further suppose that F is
    ** the high k-1 bits of f and L is the high k bits of lnb/ln2.  Then
    **
    **		scale = nint(x*lnb/ln2)
    **		      = nint[ 2^n*f*(lnb/ln2) ]
