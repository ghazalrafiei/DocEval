** PRELIMINARIES
** -------------
** 
** The mod and rem functions are defined as:
** 
** 		mod(x,y) = x - y*trunc(x/y)
** 
** 		rem(x,y) = x - y*rint(x/y)
** 
** If we denote by R any of the rounding modes defined in x_float note 19.x,
** then we can consider mod and rem as specific cases of the more general
** function, Mod, defined by: 
** 
** 		Mod(x,y,R) = x - y*rnd_to_int(x/y, R)			(1)
** 
** Now, consider the following decomposition of the binary representation of
** |x|/|y|:
** 
** 		x/y = qqqqqqqqql.rpppppppp....
** 		      \_______/   \__________/
** 		          q             u
** 
** 		    = 2*q + l + r/2 + u/2
** 
** As in note 19.x, if we know the sign of x/y (call it s), and we define k,
** the sticky bit, to be 0 if u = 0 and 1 otherwise, then for each of the
** possible rounding modes, R, there is a binary function, B(R,s,l,r,k), such
** that
** 
** 	rnd_to_int(x/y, R) = (-1)^s*[2*q + l + B(R,s,l,r,k)]
** 	                   = (-1)^[sx + sy]*[2*q + l + B(R,s,l,r,k)]
** 
** where sx and sy are the sign bits of x and y respectively.  If we denote
** B(R,s,l,r,k) by B and 2*q + l by Q, it follows that
** 
** 	Mod(x,y,R) = x - y*rnd_to_int(x/y, R)
** 	           = x - y*(-1)^[sx + sy]*[Q + B]
** 	           = (-1)^sx*|x| - (-1)^sy*|y|*(-1)^[sx + sy]*[Q + B]
** 	           = (-1)^sx*|x| - (-1)^[sx + 2*sy]*|y|*[Q + B]
** 	           = (-1)^sx*|x| - (-1)^sx*|y|*[Q + B]
** 	           = (-1)^sx*{ |x| - |y|*[Q + B] }
** 	           = (-1)^sx*{ |x| - |y|*Q - |y|*B] }
** 
** Now Q = 2*q + l = trunc(x/y) so we have:
** 
** 	Mod(x,y,R) = (-1)^sx*{ |x| - |y|*Q - |y|*B] }
** 	           = (-1)^sx*{ |x| - |y|*trunc(|x|/|y|) - |y|*B] }
** 	           = (-1)^sx*{ mod(|x|, |y|) - |y|*B] }			(2)
** 
** That is, we can compute the generalized Mod function by computing
** mod(|x|,|y|), adjusting by 0 or |y|, and then optionally negating the
** result.  With the above result in mind, for the remainder of this
** discussion, we assume that x and y are positive.
** 
** A slight variation on the above description is to compute mod(2*x, y).  The
** binary expansion of 2x/y is
** 
** 		2x/y = qqqqqqqqqlr.pppppppp....
** 		       \_______/   \__________/
** 		          q             u
** 
** 		    = 4*q + 2*l + r + u
** 
** If we denote Q = trunc(2*x/y), then l and r are the two low bits of Q and 
** k = 0 or 1 if mod(2x,y) = 0 or not.  Now
** 
** 	mod(2*x,y) = 2*x - y*trunc(2*x/y)
** 	          = 2*x - y*(4*q + 2*l + r)
** 	          = 2*x - y*(4*q + 2*l) - y*r
** 	          = 2*[x - y*(2*q + l)] - y*r
** 	          = 2*[x - y*trunc(x/y)] - y*r
** 	          = 2*mod(x,y) - y*r
** 
** Substituting the above result into (2) we get
** 
** 	Mod(x,y,R) = mod(x, y) - y*B
** 	           = [ mod(2*x) + y*r ]/2 - y*B
** 	           = mod(2*x,y)/2 + y*(r/2 - B)
** 
** Since B = 0 or 1 depending on the values of s, l, r and k, and r = 0 or 1,
** it follows that r/2 - B = -1, -1/2, 0 or 1/2 depending on s, l, r and k.
** This means we can define a function, B'(R,s,l,r,k) that takes on the values
** -2, -1, 0 or 1 and compute Mod(x,y,R) as mod(2*x)/2 + y*(B'/2)
** 
** So we are led to the following basic approach to computing the generalized
** mod function:
** 
** 	o Compute u = mod(2*|x|, |y|) keeping track of the low order
** 	  digit, Q, of the quotient 2*|x|/|y|
** 	o Based on the sign bits of x and y, the low 2 bits of Q, and x',
** 	  determine the increment value B'
** 	o Compute the generalized mod function as x' + y*B' with the sign
**	  appropriately adjusted.
**
**
** LONG DIVISION REVISITED
** -----------------------
** 
** Given x = 2^n*f and y = 2^m*g where f and g are in the interval [1/2, 1),
** the basic approach to computing the quotient, 2*x/y, is to do it one
** "digit" at a time.  That is, we essentially perform long division,
** computing one quotient digit at a time while simultaneously producing
** the remainder in the process.  Continuing the analogy to long division,
** the basic process is as follows:
** 
**		(1) At each stage, we know the current remainder, x, and the 
**		    divisor, y.
**		(2) We make a guess at the next quotient digit, Q
**		(3) Compute a new remainder, x', as x' = x - Q*y.
** 
** Since the value of Q at in step (2) was a guess, the new remainder may be
** greater than y or less than zero depending on whether Q was too small or
** too large.  In any case, we can obtain the correct Q and x' by
** incrementing or decrementing Q and adding or subtracting y from x'.
** 
** An important conclusion to draw from the above discussion is that the
** correct computation of Q is very closely tied to the computation of the
** remainder.  In particular, the two computations are not done
** independently from one another, but rather they overlap each other.
** 
** In the discussion, that follows, we present a method for computing Q
** and x' that involve a 3 step process:
** 
** 	Step 1:	Obtain a mediocre estimate of Q, call it Q" based on only
** 		the high digit of x and y.
** 	Step 2: Obtain a fairly good estimate of Q, call it Q', based on
** 		the high two digits of x and Q".  In the process, we compute
** 		the high two digits of the new remainder.
** 	Step 3: Compute the low order digits of the remaider, and adjust it
** 		and Q' accordingly to obtain the final remainder and the 
** 		exact value of Q
','line_number':41,'multiline':True]['text':'
    ** At this point, we consider the general algorithm for long division.
    ** With x = 2^n*f, y = 2^m*g consider the following algorithm:
    ** 
    ** 			 (1) J = n - m + 1
    ** 			 (2) if (J < 0) goto (11)
    ** 			 (3) if f < g
    ** 			         f' <-- f
    ** 			         Q <-- 0 
    ** 			     else
    ** 			         Q <-- 1 
    ** 			         f' <-- f - g 
    ** 			 (4) if (J <= 0) goto (11)
    ** 			 (5) t <-- (J >= k) ? k : J
    ** 			 (6) f" <-- 2^t*f'
    ** 			 (7) Q <-- trunc(f"/g)
    ** 			 (8) f' <-- f" - Q*g
    ** 			 (9) J <-- j - t
    ** 			(10) goto 4
    ** 			(11)
    ** 
    ** 				Algorithm 1
    ** 				-----------
    ** 
    ** We state here without proof that at step (11), Q is the low order digit
    ** of the quotient 2*x/y and f' is mod(2*x, y).  
    ** 
    ** The next section of code implements the first four steps of algorithm 1.

    ** COMPUTING Q"
    ** ------------
    ** 
    ** In step 7, we compute an estimate for Q, call it Q" by multiplying the
    ** high digit of 1/g by the high digit of f".  That is, we assume that we
    ** have a k-bit integer R, such that r = 2*R/M is a good approximation to
    ** 1/g.  For reasons that will be discussed later, we want r < 1/g.  In this
    ** section we describe how to compute R.
    ** 
    ** We note that the method for computing of R is almost identical to the
    ** method used to obtain the initial reciprocal approximation in the divide
    ** algorithm (see note 6.x).  The main difference being that in divide
    ** algorithm, r was to be as close to 1/g as possible, and for mod, we want
    ** r to underestimate 1/g. 
    ** 
    ** The value of R is computed using multi-precision floating point
    ** arithmetic and then is converted back to an integer data type.  We
    ** assume the existence of a floating point type with 53 bits of precision.

        ** division.)

        ** If 53 < k < 78, then define the following double precision floating
