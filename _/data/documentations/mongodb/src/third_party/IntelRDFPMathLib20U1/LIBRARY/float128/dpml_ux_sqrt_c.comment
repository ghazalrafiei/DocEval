** The following routine computes either sqrt(x) or 1/sqrt(x) for an unpacked
** argument x = 2^(2n-d)*f', f' in [1/2, 1), and d = 0 or 1.  Defining
** f = f'/2^d, the basic approach is to convert the high bits of f' to double
** precision and index into the sqrt table to evaluate a polynomial,
**  p(f') ~ 1/sqrt(f), good to about 28 bits.  Then carefully perform a Newton's
** iteration to produce an approximation to sqrt(f) or 1/sqrt(f) good to about
** 72 bits.  This result (represented by two double precision values) is then
** converted to integers and stored as the high 64 bits of the unpacked x-float
** result.  Call this result s.  Then sqrt(x) or 1/sqrt(x) is computed
** via a Newton's iteration in unpacked format as:
**
**		t <-- f*s
**		d <-- (3 - t*s)/2

    ** Given x = 2^(2n-d)*f', where d = 0 or 1 and f' is in the interval

    ** 1/sqrt(f), where f = f'/2^d.  As part of the Newton's iterations we
    ** will need f_hi as the high 24 bits of f and f_lo as the high 53 bits

    ** There is a little bit of a problem with using the DPML sqrt tables.
    ** Specifically, the table assume that f' is normalized between 1/2 and
    ** 2, so that the polynomials from the table yield a result in the
    ** interval ( 1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2) ].  For a floating point implementation,
    ** this is not a problem, but for fixed point, the interval crosses an
    ** exponent boundary.  It is much easier in fixed point to normalize
    ** between 1/4 and 1, with the result in the interval ( 1, 2 ] ( We
    ** actually force the interval to be (1, 2)).  The following table
    ** summerizes the "skew" problem and solution:

    **		Exponent				 "Swapped"

    **		   odd	   1/sqrt(2f)    sqrt2/sqrt(f)	1/sqrt(f)

    ** The sqrt table is divide into two halves, depending on the parity
    ** of the exponent.  If we "swap" the sense of the parity, we can
    ** get the result we need by multiplying by sqrt(2).

    ** Given g ~ 1/sqrt(f), we want to compute
    ** 
    **		g_lo = (g/8)*(1 - f*g^2)*(7 - 3*f*g^2)
    ** 
    ** However, computing g_lo is somewhat problematic, since there is
    ** a potential for a massive loss of significance when computing
    ** 1 - f*g^2.  To deal with this problem, we introduce the quantity, t,
    ** defined by:
    ** 
    ** 		t <-- (double)((float) f*g)
    **
    ** and reduce g to only 24 significant bits
    ','line_number':169,'multiline':True]['text':'
    ** Note that f*g and t are essentially the same values up to about
    ** 24 bits.  Then we can write
    ** 
    **		w = 1 - f*g^2
    **	 	  = 1 - (f*g)*g
    ** 		  = 1 - [t + (f*g - t)]*g

    ** Note that since g, t and f_hi have at most 24 significant bits,
    ** and since f*g ~ t, the products t*g and f_hi*g as well as the
    ** sums 1 - t*g and f_hi*g - t are all exact.  This basicly
    ** reduces the roundoff error in computing 1 - f*g^2 to a few lsbs.
    ** With the above in mind, we compute g_lo as
    **

    ** rounding g + g_lo to 64 bits.  This is done a little differently
