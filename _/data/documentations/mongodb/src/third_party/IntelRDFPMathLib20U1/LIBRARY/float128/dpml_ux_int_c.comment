** The basic approach is based on the observation that directed rounding
** can be done by "incrementing" the fraction field based on the value of
** four bits.  Consider the following diagram:
**
**	+-+-----------+------------------------+-+-+--------------+
**	|S|    exp    |                        |L|R|              |
**	+-+-----------+------------------------+-+-+--------------+
**	 ^                                     / | \
**	 |                Least significant bit  |  Rounding bit
**	sign bit                          Rounding Position
**
** Define K to be the "sticky" bit - i.e. the 'logical or' of all of the bits
** to the right of R.  Then, for a given rounding mode, the values of S, L, R
** and K uniquely determine whether or not to increment L.  Or to put it
** another way, S, L, R and K defines a binary value I to be added to L.  The
** following table defines I as a function of rounding mode and S, L, R and K
**
**				                  I

** the UX_RND_TO_INT routine is the common logic for all of the "round-to-
** integer" routines.  Most of the arguments are self explanatory.  The
** low 16 bits of the 'flags' is one of the R<Z,P,M,N,V>_BIT_VECTOR's
** described above.  Bits 16 and 17 of 'flags' determine which results to
** compute according to the flags:
**
**		INTEGER_PART
**		FRACTION_PART
**
** Additionally, UX_RND_TO_INT returns the low BITS_PER_WORD of the integer
** result.
