 * A BSONField holds the name and the type intended for a given BSON element. The
 * class helps documenting and enforcing that field's type.
 *
 * Example usages:
 *
 *     In a header file:
 *     // Determines the types for the fields used in a collection.
 *     static const std::string MyColl;
 *     struct MyCollFields {
 *         static BSONField<std::string> name;
 *         static BSONField<bool> draining;
 *         static BSONField<int> count;
 *     };
 *
 *     In a cpp file:
 *     const std::string MyColl = "my_collection_name";
 *
 *     // determines the names used for the fields
 *     BSONField<std::string> MyCollFields::name("_id");
 *     BSONField<bool> MyCollFields::draining("draining");
 *     BSONField<int> MyCollFields::count("count");
 *
 *     // Use BSONField::operator()(const T&) to instantiate a typed element for the field:
 *     BSONObj obj = BSON(MyCollFields::name("id_for_this_doc") <<
 *                        MyCollFields::draining(true) <<
 *                        MyCollFields::count(0));
 *
 *     // Use BSONField::gt() and friends to construct a basic query predicate over the field:
 *     BSONObj obj = BSON(MyCollFields::count.gt(10));
 *
 *     // Use BSONField::operator()() to retrieve the name of the field:
 *     BSONObj obj = BSON(MyCollFields::draining() << 1);
