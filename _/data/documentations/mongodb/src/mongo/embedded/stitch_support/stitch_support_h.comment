 * An object which describes the details of the failure of an operation.
 *
 * The Stitch Support Library uses allocated objects of this type to report the details of any
 * failure, when an operation cannot be completed. Several `stitch_support_v1_status` functions are
 * provided which permit observing the details of these failures. Further a construction function
 * and a destruction function for these objects are also provided.
 *
 * The use of status objects from multiple threads is not thread safe unless all of the threads
 * accessing a single status object are passing that object as a const-qualified (const
 * stitch_support_v1_status *) pointer. If a single thread is passing a status object to a function
 * taking it by non-const-qualified (stitch_support_v1_status*) pointer, then no other thread may
 * access the status object.
 *
 * The `status` parameter is optional for all `stitch_support_v1_` functions that can take a status
 * pointer. The caller may pass NULL instead of a valid `status` object, in which case the function
 * will execute normally but will not provide any detailed error information in the caes of a
 * failure.
 *
 * All `stitch_support_v1_status` functions can be used before the Stitch Support library is
 * initialized. This facilitates detailed error reporting from all library functions.
 ','line_number':71,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Allocate and construct an API-return-status buffer object.

 ','line_number':95,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Destroys a valid status object.
 *
 * The status object must not be NULL and must be a valid stitch_support_v1_status object.

 * that accesses the status object being destroyed. It is, however, safe to destroy distinct status
 * objects on distinct threads.
 *

 ','line_number':104,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * The error codes reported by `stitch_support_v1` functions will be given the symbolic names as

 *
 * When a `stitch_support_v1` function fails (and it has been documented to report errors) it will
 * report that error in the form of an `int` status code. That status code will always be returned
 * as the type `int`; however, the values in this enum can be used to classify the failure.

 * When a `stitch_support_v1` function fails (and it has been documented to report errors) it will
 * report its error in the form of an `int` status code which is stored into a supplied
 * `stitch_support_v1_status` object, if provided. Some of these functions may also report extra
 * information, which will be reported by other observer functions. Every `stitch_support_v1`
 * function which reports errors will always update the `Error` code stored in a
 * `stitch_support_v1_status` object, even upon success.
 *
 * This function does not report its own failures.

 * Gets a descriptive error message from a `stitch_support_v1_status` object.
 *
 * For failures where the error is STITCH_SUPPORT_V1_ERROR_EXCEPTION, this returns a string
 * representation of the internal C++ exception.
 *
 * The function to which the specified status object was passed must not have returned
 * STITCH_SUPPORT_V1_SUCCESS as its error code.
 *
 * The storage for the returned string is associated with the specified status object, and therefore
 * it will be deallocated when the status is destroyed using stitch_support_v1_destroy_status().
 *
 * This function does not report its own failures.
 ','line_number':161,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Gets a status code from a `stitch_support_v1_status` object.
 *
 * Returns a numeric status code associated with the status parameter which indicates a sub-category

 *
 * For any status object that does not have STITCH_SUPPORT_V1_ERROR_EXCEPTION as its error, the
 * value of this code is unspecified.
 *
 * This function does not report its own failures.
 ','line_number':178,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * An object which describes the runtime state of the Stitch Support Library.
 *
 * The Stitch Support Library uses allocated objects of this type to indicate the present state of
 * the library. Some operations which the library provides need access to this object. Further a
 * construction function and a destruction function for these objects are also provided. No more
 * than a single object instance of this type may exist at any given time.
 *
 * The use of `stitch_support_v1_lib` objects from multiple threads is not thread safe unless all of
 * the threads accessing a single `stitch_support_v1_lib` object are not destroying this object.  If

 ','line_number':252,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * A matcher object is used to determine if a BSON document matches a predicate.
 *
 * A matcher can optionally use a collator. The client is responsible for ensuring that a matcher's

 *
 * The 'collator' argument, a pointer to a stitch_support_v1_collator, will cause the matcher to use

 * Check if the 'documentBSON' input matches the predicate represented by the 'matcher' object.
 *
 * The 'matcher' and 'documentBSON' parameters must point to initialized objects of their respective

 *
 * When the check is successful, this function returns STITCH_SUPPORT_V1_SUCCESS, sets 'isMatch' to

 * A projection object is used to apply a projection to a BSON document which may include or exclude
 * particular fields (e.g.: {_id: 0, a: 1}) or produce new columns through an expression made of
 * projection operators.
 *
 * A projection requires a matcher if it uses the positional ($) operator. This matcher is used to
 * determine which array element matches the specified position. The matcher is optional and unused
 * when there is no positional operator.
 *
 * A projection can optionally use a collator for evaluating $elemMatch operators. Projection
 * objects without collators will use the default collation for $elemMatch, even if their matcher
 * has a collator object. Multiple matcher, projection, and update objects can share the same
 * collation object.
 ','line_number':322,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Creates a stitch_support_v1_projection object, which is used to apply a projection to a BSON
 * document. The projection specification is also represented as a BSON document, which is passed in

 * (i.e., not an aggregation $project stage).
 *
 * This function will fail if the projection specification is invalid, returning NULL and populating
 * 'status' with information about the error.
 *
 * If the projection specification includes a positional ($) operator, then the caller must pass a

 * positional operator and it can be NULL.
 *
 * The 'collator' argument, a pointer to a stitch_support_v1_collator, will cause the projection to
 * use the given collator if provided, The pointer can be NULL to cause the projection to use no

 ','line_number':450,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Creates a stitch_support_v1_update object by parsing the update expression provided in the

 *
 * The optional 'arrayFiltersBSON' argument must be a BSON array where each element of the array

 * are no array filters. If 'updateBSON' contains a placeholder ($[*]) that does not have a
 * corresponding 'arrayFiltersBSON' entry this function will fail to parse.
 *
 * This function will fail if either 'updateBSON' or 'arrayFiltersBSON fails to parse, returning
