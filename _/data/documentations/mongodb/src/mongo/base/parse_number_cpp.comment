 * Returns the value of the digit "c", with the same conversion behavior as strtol.

 * Assumes "c" is an ASCII character or UTF-8 octet.

 * Assuming "stringValue" represents a parseable number, extracts the sign and returns a
 * substring with any sign characters stripped away.  "*isNegative" is set to true if the
 * number is negative, and false otherwise.
 ','line_number':67,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Assuming "stringValue" represents a parseable number, determines what base to use given
 * "inputBase".  Stores the correct base into "*outputBase".  Follows strtol rules.  If
 * "inputBase" is not 0, *outputBase is set to "inputBase".  Otherwise, if "stringValue" starts
 * with "0x" or "0X", sets outputBase to 16, or if it starts with 0, sets outputBase to 8.
 *
 * Returns stringValue, unless it sets *outputBase to 16, in which case it will strip off the
 * "0x" or "0X" prefix, if present.
