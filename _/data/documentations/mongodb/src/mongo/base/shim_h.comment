 * The `WeakFunction` mechanism allows for the creation of "weak-symbol-like" functions
 * which can have implementations injected into a link target without creating a link
 * dependency. This is used for injecting factory functions and mocks.
 *
 * DEPRECATION WARNING:
 * This library was created as a one-time expediency to resolve technical debt in the
 * link dependency graph. It should not be used in new designs, and existing uses will
 * continue to be phased out over time.

     * Get the function slot for `key`. Creating a new empty slot if necessary.
     * The slot thus created is permanently associated with function type `F`.
     * Throws if `key` is not associated with the requested function type `F`.
     ','line_number':69,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Make `f` the implementation of function `key`. Subsequent `getSlot<F>(key)` calls
     * will return a slot mapped to a function object that invokes `f` when called.
     *
     * Throws if a previous call with the same `key` and `priority` was made. If keys
     * collide, but at differing priorities, the function that was installed with the
     * greater priority gets the slot.

 * Associates an implementation function with a name in the global WeakFunction registry.
 * A registration object, useful only for its constructor's side effects.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   // Inject an implementation of the WeakFunction "badSqrt".
 *   static double badSqrtImpl(double x) {
 *     return std::sqrt(x) + 1;
 *   }
 *   static auto sqrtRegistration = WeakFunctionRegistration("badSqrt", badSqrtImpl);
 *
 *   // Elsewhere...
 *   double badSqrt(double x) {
 *     // Use a WeakFunction to allow injected implementations of badSqrt.
 *     static auto weak = WeakFunction<double(double)>("badSqrt");
 *     return weak(x);
 *   }
 *
 * The macros below help with the syntax a bit. The example can be updated to use the
 * MONGO_WEAK_FUNCTION_ macros.
 *
 *   static double badSqrtImpl(double x) {
 *     return std::sqrt(x) + 1;
 *   }
 *   static auto sqrtRegistration = MONGO_WEAK_FUNCTION_REGISTRATION(badSqrt, badSqrtImpl);
 *
 *   // Elsewhere...
 *   double badSqrt(double x) {
 *     // Use a WeakFunction to allow injected implementations of badSqrt.
 *     // Notice that the function type of `double(double)` is implicitly determined.
 *     static auto weak = MONGO_WEAK_FUNCTION_DEFINITION(badSqrt);
 *     return weak(x);
 *   }
