 ','line_number':1,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Utility functions for parsing numbers from strings.
 ','line_number':30,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Builder pattern for setting up a number parser. Intended usage:
 *     long result;
 *     char* end;
 *     NumberParser()
 *     .base(16)
 *     .allowTrailingText()
 *     .skipWhitespace()
 *     ("\t\n    0x16hello, world", &result, &end);
 *     //end points to 'h' and result holds 22
 ','line_number':44,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Behave like strtol/atoi and skip whitespace at the beginning of the string
     ','line_number':57,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Set a base for the conversion. 0 means infer the base akin to strtol.
     * Legal bases are [2-35]. If a base outside of this is selected, then operator()
     * will return BadValue.
     ','line_number':65,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * Acts like atoi/strtol and will still parse even if there are non-numeric characters in the
     * string after the number. Without this option, the parser will return FailedToParse if there
     * are leftover characters in the parsed string.
     ','line_number':75,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * returns a NumberParser configured like strtol/atoi
     ','line_number':91,'multiline':True]['text':'
     * Parsing overloads for different supported numerical types.
     *
     * On success, the parsed value is stored into *result and returns Status::OK().
     * If endPtr is not nullptr, the end of the number portion of the string will be stored at
     * *endPtr (like strtol).
     * This will return with Status::FailedToParse if the string does not represent a number value.
     * See skipWhitespace and allowTrailingText for ways to expand the parser's capabilities.
     * Returns with Status::Overflow if the parsed number cannot be represented by the desired type.
     * If the status is not OK, then there are no guarantees about what value will be stored in
     * result.
