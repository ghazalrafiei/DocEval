 * Synopsis:
 *
 *   bool mul(A a, A b, T* r);
 *   bool add(A a, A b, T* r);
 *   bool sub(A a, A b, T* r);
 *
 * The domain type `A` evaluates to `T`, which is deduced from the `r` parameter.
 * That is, the input parameters are coerced into the type accepted by the output parameter.
 * All functions return true if operation would overflow, otherwise they store result in `*r`.

 * Safe mod function which throws if the divisor is 0 and avoids potential overflow in cases where
 * the divisor is -1. If the absolute value of the divisor is 1, mod will always return 0. We fast-
 * path this to avoid the scenario where the dividend is the smallest negative long or int value and
 * the divisor is -1. Naively performing this % may result in an overflow when the -2^N value is
 * divided and becomes 2^N. See SERVER-43699.
