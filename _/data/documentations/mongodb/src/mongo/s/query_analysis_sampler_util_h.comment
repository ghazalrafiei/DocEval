 * Returns a unique sample id for a query if it should be sampled, and none otherwise. Can only be
 * invoked once for each query since generating a sample id causes the number of remaining queries
 * to sample to get decremented.

 * Similar to 'tryGenerateSampleId()' but assigns the sample id to a random shard out of the given

 * To be invoked by commands on mongod. On a mongod that does not support persisting sampled
 * queries, returns none. On a mongod in a shardsvr replica set, returns the sample id attached in
 * the request. On a mongod in a standalone replica set, returns the sample id as generated by
 * 'tryGenerateSampleId'.
