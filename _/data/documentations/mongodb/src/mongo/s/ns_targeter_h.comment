 * The NSTargeter interface is used by a WriteOp to generate and target child write operations
 * to a particular collection.
 *
 * The lifecyle of a NSTargeter is:
 *
 *   0. targetDoc/targetQuery as many times as is required
 *
 *   1a. On targeting failure we may need to refresh, note that it happened.
 *   1b. On stale config from a child write operation we may need to refresh, note the error.
 *
 *   2. refreshIfNeeded() to get newer targeting information
 *
 *   3. Goto 0.
 *
 * The refreshIfNeeded() operation must try to make progress against noted targeting or stale
 * config failures, see comments below.  No functions may block for shared resources or network
 * calls except refreshIfNeeded().
 *
 * Implementers are free to define more specific targeting error codes to allow more complex
 * error handling.
 *
 * The interface must not be used from multiple threads.

     * Returns a ShardEndpoint for a single document write or throws ShardKeyNotFound if 'doc' is

     * Refreshes the targeting metadata for the namespace if needed, based on previously-noted
     * stale responses and targeting failures.
     *
     * After this function is called, the targeter should be in a state such that the noted
     * stale responses are not seen again and if a targeting failure occurred it reloaded -
     * it should try to make progress.
     *
     * Returns if the targeting used here was changed.
