 * Presents an interface for talking to shards, regardless of whether that shard is remote or is
 * the current (local) shard.
 ','line_number':71,'multiline':True]['text':'*
         * Takes the response from running a batch write command and writes the appropriate response
         * into batchResponse, while also returning the Status of the operation.
         ','line_number':87,'multiline':True]['text':'*
         * Returns an error status if either commandStatus or writeConcernStatus has an error.
         ','line_number':94,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns true if this shard object represents the config server.
     ','line_number':123,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the current connection string for the shard.
     ','line_number':128,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the RemoteCommandTargeter for the hosts in this shard.
     *
     * This is only valid to call on ShardRemote instances.
     ','line_number':133,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Notifies the RemoteCommandTargeter owned by the shard of a particular mode of failure for
     * the specified host.
     *
     * This is only valid to call on ShardRemote instances.
     ','line_number':140,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns a string description of this shard entry.
     ','line_number':149,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns whether a server operation which failed with the given error code should be retried
     * (i.e. is safe to retry and has the potential to succeed next time).  The 'options' argument
     * describes whether the operation that generated the given code was idempotent, which affects
     * which codes are safe to retry on.
     *
     * isRetriableError() routes to either of the static functions depending on object type.
     ','line_number':154,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Runs the specified command returns the BSON command response plus parsed out Status of this
     * response and write concern error (if present). Retries failed operations according to the
     * given "retryPolicy".  Retries indefinitely until/unless a non-retriable error is encountered,
     * the maxTimeMs on the OperationContext expires, or the operation is interrupted.
     ','line_number':166,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Same as the other variant of runCommand, but allows the operation timeout to be overriden.
     * Runs for the lesser of the remaining time on the operation context or the specified maxTimeMS
     * override.
     ','line_number':178,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Same as runCommand, but will only retry failed operations up to 3 times, regardless of
     * the retryPolicy or the remaining maxTimeMs.
     * Wherever possible this method should be avoided in favor of runCommand.
     ','line_number':190,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Same as runCommand, but will only retry failed operations up to 3 times, regardless of

     ','line_number':202,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Schedules the command to be sent to the shard asynchronously. Does not provide any guarantee
     * on whether the command is actually sent or even scheduled successfully.
     ','line_number':215,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Runs a cursor command, exhausts the cursor, and pulls all data into memory. Performs retries
     * if the command fails in accordance with the kIdempotent RetryPolicy.
     ','line_number':224,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Synchronously run the aggregation request, with a best effort honoring of request
     * options. `callback` will be called with the batch and resume token contained in each
     * response. `callback` should return `true` to execute another getmore. Returning `false` will
     * send a `killCursors`. If the aggregation results are exhausted, there will be no additional
     * calls to `callback`.
     ','line_number':234,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Runs a write command against a shard. This is separate from runCommand, because write
     * commands return errors in a different format than regular commands do, so checking for
     * retriable errors must be done differently.
     ','line_number':247,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Warning: This method exhausts the cursor and pulls all data into memory.
     * Do not use other than for very small (i.e., admin or metadata) collections.
     * Performs retries if the query fails in accordance with the kIdempotent RetryPolicy.
     *
     * ShardRemote instances expect "readConcernLevel" to always be kMajorityReadConcern, whereas
     * ShardLocal instances expect either kLocalReadConcern or kMajorityReadConcern.
     ','line_number':257,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns false if the error is a retriable error and/or causes a replset monitor update. These
     * errors, if from a remote call, should not be further propagated back to another server
     * because that server will interpret them as orignating on this server rather than the one this
     * server called.
     ','line_number':275,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Runs the specified command against the shard backed by this object with a timeout set to the
     * minimum of maxTimeMSOverride or the timeout of the OperationContext.
     *
     * The return value exposes RemoteShard's host for calls to updateReplSetMonitor.
     *
     * NOTE: LocalShard implementation will not return a valid host and so should be ignored.
     ','line_number':287,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Identifier of the shard as obtained from the configuration data (i.e. shard0000).
