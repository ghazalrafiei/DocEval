 * This class wraps an IndexVersion timestamp with a disambiguating sequence number and a forced
 * refresh sequence number. When a collection is dropped and recreated, the index version resets to
 * boost::none. This cannot be compared with a valid timestamp, so the disambiguatingSequenceNumber
 * is used to compare those cases.
 *
 * Two ComparableIndexVersions with no indexes (boost::none timestamp) will always be the same
 * regardless of the collection they refer to.

     * cannot be inferred.
