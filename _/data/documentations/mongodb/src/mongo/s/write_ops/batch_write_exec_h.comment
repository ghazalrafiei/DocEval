 * The BatchWriteExec is able to execute client batch write requests, resulting in a batch
 * response to send back to the client.
 *
 * There are two main interfaces the exec uses to "run" the batch:
 *
 *  - the "targeter" used to generate child batch operations to send to particular shards
 *
 *  - the "dispatcher" used to send child batches to several shards at once, and retrieve the
 *    results
 *
 * Both the targeter and dispatcher are assumed to be dedicated to this particular
 * BatchWriteExec instance.
