 * There is one instance of this object per service context on each shard node (primary or
 * secondary). It sits at the top of the hierarchy of the Shard Role runtime-authoritative caches
 * (the subordinate ones being the DatabaseShardingState and CollectionShardingState) and contains
 * global information about the shardedness of the current process, such as its shardId and the
 * clusterId to which it belongs.
 *
 * SYNCHRONISATION: This class can only be initialised once and if 'setInitialized' is called, it
 * never gets destroyed or uninitialized. Because of this it does not require external
 * synchronisation. Initialisation is driven from outside (specifically
 * ShardingInitializationMongoD, which should be its only caller).

     * Non-blocking method which can be used to wait for the cluster role recovery to complete,
     * ensuring that any sharding-state dependent services can now proceed.

     * When the future returned by this method is signaled (whether with success or an error) it is

     * This is the polling variant of `awaitClusterRoleRecovery` above. Until the cluster role
     * recovery process has not yet completed, it will keep returning ClusterRole::None. If the
     * recovery completes with an success it will return the role of the node, which is guaranteed
     * to not change. If the recovery completes with an error, it will throw and never return
     * success.

     * TODO (SERVER-83326): Usages of this method should go away because we shouldn't have code that
     * makes decisions based on the role of the node. Instead, code should just use acquisitions
     * which under the hood will ensure that the correct behaviour is achieved based on the current
     * role of the node and any other code should rely on awaitClusterRoleRecovery in order to
     * switch its execution flow.
