 * ClusterClientCursor is used to generate results from cursor-generating commands on one or
 * more remote hosts. A cursor-generating command (e.g. the find command) is one that
 * establishes a ClientCursor and a matching cursor id on the remote host. In order to retrieve
 * all command results, getMores must be issued against each of the remote cursors until they
 * are exhausted.
 *
 * Results are generated using a pipeline of mongoS query execution stages called RouterExecStage.
 *
 * Does not throw exceptions.

     * If there are no further results, the end of the stream is indicated with an empty
     * QueryResult and an ok status.
     *
     * A non-ok status is returned in case of any error.
