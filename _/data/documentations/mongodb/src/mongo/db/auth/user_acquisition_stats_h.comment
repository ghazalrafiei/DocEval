 * RAII handle that is used to mutate a UserAcquisitionStats object. It automatically records
 * the start time of either an LDAP or User Cache Acquisition operation upon construction.
 * Additionally, it guarantees that an ongoing user attempt will be recorded as complete as
 * soon as the handle goes out of scope. This ensures that a call to the corresponding
 * operations set end timer  will be called even if an exception is thrown.
