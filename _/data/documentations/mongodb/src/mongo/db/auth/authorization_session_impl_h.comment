 * Contains all the authorization logic for a single client connection.  It contains a set of
 * the users which have been authenticated, as well as a set of privileges that have been
 * granted to those users to perform various actions.
 *
 * An AuthorizationSession object is present within every mongo::Client object.
 *
 * The active _authenticatedUser may get marked as invalid by the AuthorizationManager,
 * for instance if their privileges are changed by a user or role modification command.  At the
 * beginning of every user-initiated operation startRequest() gets called which updates
 * the cached information about any users who have been marked as invalid.  This guarantees that
 * every operation looks at one consistent view of each user for every auth check required over
 * the lifetime of the operation.
