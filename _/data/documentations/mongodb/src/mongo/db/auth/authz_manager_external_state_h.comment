     * Writes into "result" a document describing the requested user and returns Status::OK().
     * The caller is required to provide all information necessary to unique identify the request
     * for a user, including the user's name and any roles which the user must possess via
     * out-of-band attestation. The returned description includes the user credentials and
     * customData, if present, the user's role membership and delegation information, a full
     * list of the user's privileges, and a full list of the user's roles, including those
     * roles held implicitly through other roles (indirect roles). In the event that some of this
     * information is inconsistent, the document will contain a "warnings" array,
     * with std::string messages describing inconsistencies.

     * Writes into "result" documents describing the roles that are defined on the given

     * returned, where each document includes the other roles a particular role is a
     * member of, including those role memberships held implicitly through other roles
     * (indirect roles). If showPrivileges is kShowPrivileges, then the description documents
     * will also include a full list of the roles' privileges. If showBuiltinRoles is true, then
     * the result array will contain description documents for all the builtin roles for the given
     * database, if it is false the result will just include user defined roles. In the event that

     * contain a "warnings" array, with std::string messages describing inconsistencies.
