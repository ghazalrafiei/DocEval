 * The SessionKiller enforces a single thread for session killing for any given ServiceContext.
 *
 * The killer owns a background thread which actually does the work, and callers batch their kills
 * together each round, before the killer starts its dispatching, after which they batch up for the
 * next round.
 *
 * The KillFunc's kill function is passed in to its constructor, and parameterizes its behavior
 * depending on context (mongod/mongos).

     * The Result of a call is either:
     *
     * Status::OK(), empty vector - we killed everything
     * Status::OK(), filled vector - we killed something.  HostAndPort is filled with nodes we
     *                               failed to kill on.
     *
     * !Status::OK() - The kill function itself failed.  I.e. we may have killed nothing.
     *
     * This contract has a helper in kill_sessions_common.h which adapts results for command
     * implementations. (killSessionsCmdHelper)

     * For regular sessions, the Matcher will directly match an lsid pattern. For internal sessions,
     * the Matcher will return matches on the child sessions of a parent session as well.

     * This is the api for killSessions commands to invoke the killer.  It blocks until the kill is
     * finished, or until it fails (times out on all nodes in mongos).

     * This struct is a helper to default fill in the result, which is otherwise a little error
     * prone.
