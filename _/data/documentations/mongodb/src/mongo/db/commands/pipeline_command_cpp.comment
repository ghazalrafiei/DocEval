     * It's not known until after parsing whether or not an aggregation command is an explain
     * request, because it might include the `explain: true` field (ie. aggregation explains do not
     * need to arrive via the `explain` command). Therefore even parsing of regular aggregation
     * commands needs to be able to handle the explain case.
     *
     * As a result, aggregation command parsing is done in parseForExplain():
     *
     * - To parse a regular aggregation command, call parseForExplain() with `explainVerbosity` of
     *   boost::none.
     *
     * - To parse an aggregation command as the sub-command in an `explain` command, call
     *   parseForExplain() with `explainVerbosity` set to the desired verbosity.
