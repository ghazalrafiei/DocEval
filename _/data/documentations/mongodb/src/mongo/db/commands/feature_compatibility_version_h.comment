     * Reads the featureCompatibilityVersion (FCV) document in admin.system.version and initializes
     * the FCV global state. Returns an error if the FCV document exists and is invalid. Does not
     * return an error if it is missing. This should be checked after startup with
     * fassertInitializedAfterStartup.
     *
     * Throws a MustDowngrade error if an existing FCV document contains an invalid version.

     * Adds a transition that allows users to downgrade from latest FCV to last continuous FCV.
     * This function should only be called if the 'disableTransitionFromLatestToLastContinuous'
     * server parameter is set to 'false'. That parameter is test-only and defaulted to 'true'.

     * If we are in clean startup (the server has no replicated collections), store the

     * Returns a scoped object, which holds the 'fcvLock' in exclusive mode for the given scope. It

     * Used by the FCV OpObserver to set the timestamp of the last opTime where the FCV was updated.
     * We use this to ensure the user does not see a non-transitional FCV that is not in the
     * majority snapshot, since upgrading or downgrading will not work in that circumstance.
     ','line_number':130,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Used by the FCV OpObserver at rollback time.  The rollback FCV is always in the
     * majority snapshot, so it is safe to clear the lastFCVUpdateTimestamp then.
     *
     * Also used in rare cases when the replication coordinator majority snapshot is cleared.
     ','line_number':137,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Utility class to prevent the on-disk FCV from changing while the FixedFCVRegion is in scope.
 *
 * Note that this does not prevent the in-memory FCV from changing (which for example could be reset
 * during initial sync). The operator* and operator-> functions return a MutableFCV, which could
 * change at different points in time, so if you wanted to get a consistent snapshot of the
 * in-memory FCV, you should still use the ServerGlobalParams::MutableFCV's acquireFCVSnapshot()
 * function.
