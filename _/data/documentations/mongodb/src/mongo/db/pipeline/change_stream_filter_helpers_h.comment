 * Produce a timestamp filter that starts an oplog scan at a specific time.
 ','line_number':43,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Produce a filter that rejects any operations marked with the "fromMigrate" flag. These operations
 * occurs as part of chunk migration and should not be visible to user change streams, because they
 * don't reflect user operations to the database.
 ','line_number':51,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Produce a filter that includes operations marked fromMigrate:true when showSystemEvents feature
 * is set.
 ','line_number':59,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Produce an oplog filter which captures all operations relevant to change streams, including CRUD
 * events and certain commands. Depending on the 'userMatch' $match expression, this filter may be
 * able to reject some entries before they get transformed into change stream entries.
 ','line_number':66,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Produce an oplog filter which captures DDL operations for views (i.e. create, drop and modify).
 ','line_number':74,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Produce an oplog filter which matches any operation that should cause the change stream to be
 * invalidated. The filter generated by this function will differ depending on the type of change
 * stream being constructed.
 ','line_number':80,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Produce a filter matching any 'applyOps' or 'commitTransaction' commands that commit a
 * transaction. An 'applyOps' command implicitly commits a transaction if _both_ of the following
 * are true: 1) it is not marked with the 'partialTxn' field, which would indicate that there are
 * more entries to come in the transaction and 2) it is not marked with the 'prepare' field, which
 * would indicate that the transaction is only committed if there is a follow-up 'commitTransaction'
 * command in the oplog.
 *
 * This filter will ignore all but the last 'applyOps' command in a transaction comprising multiple
 * 'applyOps' commands, and it will ignore all 'applyOps' commands in a prepared transaction. The
 * change stream traverses back through the oplog to recover the ignored commands when it sees an
 * entry that commits a transaction.
 *
 * As an optimization, this filter also ignores any transaction with just a single 'applyOps' if
 * that 'applyOps' does not contain any updates that modify the namespace that the change stream is
 * watching.
 ','line_number':88,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Produce a filter matching any operations for internal change stream use. These events must not be
 * filtered out by the change stream's oplog scan, even if they are not ultimately returned to the
 * user.
 ','line_number':108,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Returns the match filter for the classic changestream operations.
