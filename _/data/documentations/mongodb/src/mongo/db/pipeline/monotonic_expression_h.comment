 * Given monotonic states of functions f(x) and g(x), returns monotonic state of f(x)+g(x). Plus
 * operator can be replaced with any operation that preserves monotonic behavior.
 *
 * If any argument is non monotonic, then the whole function is non monotonic.
 * If one of the arguments is a constant, then the whole function has the same monotonic state as
 * the other argument. If all arguments have the the same monotonic state, then the whole function
 * has the same monotonic state. Otherwise, the result is NonMonotonic.
