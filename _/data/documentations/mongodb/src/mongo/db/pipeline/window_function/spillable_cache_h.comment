 * A deque like structure that spills to disk if the contents of the deque are larger than the given
 * maximum memory. Contents on disk are in a temporary table that will be cleaned up on startup if
 * the server crashes with data still present. Ids are not indexes into the deque but rather the
 * document number of the Documents inserted into the cache.

     * Adds 'input' to the in-memory cache and spills to disk if the document size puts us over the
     * memory limit and spilling is allowed.
     *
     * Note that the reported approximate size of 'input' may include the internal Document field
     * cache along with the underlying BSON size, which can change depending on the access pattern.
     * This class assumes that the size of the Document does not change from the time that it's
     * added here until it's freed via freeUpTo().

     * Destroy the SpillableCache. No other functions should be called after finalize.
     * This function acquires a lock and can throw, and therefore should not be called in a
     * destructor (or any environment where it is not safe to throw). If this is not called before
     * the SpillableCache is destructed the temporary table will eventually be cleaned up by the
     * storage engine.
