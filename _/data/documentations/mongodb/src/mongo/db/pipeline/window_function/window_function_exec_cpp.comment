 * Translates the input Expression to suit certain window function's need. For example, $integral
 * window function requires the input value to be a 2-sized Value vector containing the evaluating
 * value of 'sortBy' and 'input' field. So we create an 'ExpressionArray' as the input Expression
 * for Executors.
 *
 * Returns the 'input' in 'expr' if no extra translation is needed.
