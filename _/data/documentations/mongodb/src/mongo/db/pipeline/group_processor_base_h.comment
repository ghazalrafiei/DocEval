     * Sets the expression to use to determine the group id of each document.
     * This must be called before setExecutionStarted().

     * Returns the field names, if any, used to determine the group id of each document.
     * This vector is non-empty only when the expression sent to setIdExpression() is an

     * Returns the expression used to determine the group id of each document.
