 * This aggregation stage is the ‘$_internalAllCollectionStats´. It takes no arguments. Its
 * response will be a cursor, each document of which represents the collection statistics for a
 * single collection for all the existing collections.
 *
 * When executing the '$_internalAllCollectionStats' aggregation stage, we will need to obtain the
 * catalog containing all collections namespaces.
 *
 * Then, for each collection, we will call `makeStatsForNs` method from DocumentSourceCollStats that
 * will retrieve all storage stats for that particular collection.
