 * Split the current Pipeline into a Pipeline for each shard, and a Pipeline that combines the
 * results within a merging process. This call also performs optimizations with the aim of reducing
 * computing time and network traffic when a pipeline has been split into two pieces.
 *
 * The 'mergePipeline' returned as part of the SplitPipeline here is not ready to execute until the
 * 'shardsPipeline' has been sent to the shards and cursors have been established. Once cursors have
 * been established, the merge pipeline can be made executable by calling 'addMergeCursorsSource()'

 * Targets shards for the pipeline and returns a struct with the remote cursors or results, and the
 * pipeline that will need to be executed to merge the results from the remotes. If a stale shard
 * version is encountered, refreshes the routing table and tries again. If the command is eligible
 * for sampling, attaches a unique sample id to the request for one of the targeted shards if the
 * collection has query sampling enabled and the rate-limited sampler successfully generates a
 * sample id for it.
 *
 * Although the 'pipeline' has an 'ExpressionContext' which indicates whether this operation is an
 * explain (and if it is an explain what the verbosity is), the caller must explicitly indicate
 * whether it wishes to dispatch a regular aggregate command or an explain command using the
 * explicit 'explain' parameter. The reason for this is that in some contexts, the caller wishes to
 * dispatch a regular agg command rather than an explain command even if the top-level operation is
 * an explain. Consider the example of an explain that contains a stage like this:
 *
 *     {$unionWith: {coll: "innerShardedColl", pipeline: <sub-pipeline>}}
 *
 * The explain works by first executing the inner and outer subpipelines in order to gather runtime
 * statistics. While dispatching the inner pipeline, we must dispatch it not as an explain but as a
 * regular agg command so that the runtime stats are accurate.
 ','line_number':152,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Convenience method for callers that want to do 'partitionCursors', 'injectMetaCursors', and
 * 'addMergeCursorsSource' in order.
 ','line_number':202,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Targets the shards with an aggregation command built from `ownedPipeline` and explain set to
 * true. Returns a BSONObj of the form {"pipeline": {<pipelineExplainOutput>}}.
 ','line_number':210,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Appends the explain output of `dispatchResults` to `result`.
 ','line_number':216,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Returns the proper routing table to use for targeting shards: either a historical routing table
 * based on the global read timestamp if there is an active transaction with snapshot level read
 * concern or the latest routing table otherwise.
 *
 * Returns 'ShardNotFound' or 'NamespaceNotFound' if there are no shards in the cluster or if
 * collection 'execNss' does not exist, respectively.
 ','line_number':223,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Returns true if an aggregation over 'nss' must run on all shards.
 ','line_number':234,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Retrieves the desired retry policy based on whether the default writeConcern is set on 'opCtx'.
 ','line_number':239,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Prepares the given pipeline for execution. This involves:
 * (1) Determining if the pipeline needs to have a cursor source attached.
 * (2) If a cursor source is needed, attaching one. This may involve a local or remote cursor,
 * depending on whether or not the pipeline's expression context permits local reads and a local
 * read could be used to serve the pipeline. (3) Splitting the pipeline if required, and dispatching
 * half to the shards, leaving the merging half executing in this process after attaching a
 * $mergeCursors.
 *
 * Will retry on network errors and also on StaleConfig errors to avoid restarting the entire
 * operation. Returns `ownedPipeline`, but made-ready for execution.
 ','line_number':244,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * For a sharded collection, establishes remote cursors on each shard that may have results, and
 * creates a DocumentSourceMergeCursors stage to merge the remote cursors. Returns a pipeline
 * beginning with that DocumentSourceMergeCursors stage. Note that one of the 'remote' cursors might
 * be this node itself.
 *
 * Even if the ExpressionContext indicates that this operation is explain, this function still
 * dispatches the pipeline as a non-explain, since it must open cursors on the remote nodes and
 * merge them with a $mergeCursors. If the caller's intent is to dispatch an explain command, it
 * must use a different helper.
 *
 * Use the AggregateCommandRequest alternative for 'targetRequest' to explicitly specify command
 * options (e.g. read concern) to the shards when establishing remote cursors. Note that doing so
 * incurs the cost of parsing the pipeline.
 *
 * Use the std::pair<AggregateCommandRequest, std::unique_ptr<Pipeline, PipelineDeleter>>
 * alternative for 'targetRequest' to explicitly specify command options (e.g. read concern) to the
 * shards when establishing remote cursors, and to pass a pipeline that has already been parsed.
 * This is useful when the pipeline has already been parsed as it avoids the cost
 * of parsing it again.
 ','line_number':261,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * For a sharded or unsharded collection, establishes a remote cursor on only the specified shard,
 * and creates a DocumentSourceMergeCursors stage to consume the remote cursor. Returns a pipeline
 * beginning with that DocumentSourceMergeCursors stage.
 *
 * This function bypasses normal shard targeting for sharded and unsharded collections. It is
 * especially useful for reading from unsharded collections such as config.transactions and
 * local.oplog.rs that cannot be targeted by targetShardsAndAddMergeCursors().
 *
 * Note that the specified AggregateCommandRequest must not be for an explain command.
