     * This method works on preparation for $search in top level pipeline, or inner pipeline that is
     * dispatched to shards. Nothing is done if first stage in the pipeline is not $search, and this
     * method should only be invoked for the DocumentSource-based implementation.
     * The preparation works includes:
     * 1. Desugars $search stage into $_internalSearchMongotRemote and $_internalSearchIdLookup
     * stages.
     * 2. injects shard filterer for $_internalSearchIdLookup stage on shard only.
