     * Returns the cycle/timestamp counter of the processor using platform-specific instructions.
     *
     * We use `rdtsc` (Read Time-Stamp Counter) on x86, followed by a `lfence` to properly order the
     * execution of `rdtsc` with the instructions that follow. The instruction reads the processorâ€™s
     * time-stamp counter into two 32-bit registers (i.e. EDX and EAX).
     *
     * On AArch64, we query the contents of the `cntvct` register after issuing an `isb` to enforce
     * ordering for the counter read, as suggested by AArch64's Generic Timer documentation:
     * https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102379/latest/
     *
     * The inline assembly instructions can be replaced with intrinsics, if desired.
