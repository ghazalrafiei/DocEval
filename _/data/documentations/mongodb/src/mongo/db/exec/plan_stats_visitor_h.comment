 * Visitor pattern for PlanStageStats.
 *
 * This code is not responsible for traversing the PlanStageStats tree, only for performing the
 * double-dispatch.
 *
 * If the visitor doesn't intend to modify the plan stats, then the template argument 'IsConst'
 * should be set to 'true'. In this case all 'visit()' methods will take a const pointer to a
 * visiting node.

 * This class provides null implementations for all visit methods so that a derived class can
 * override visit method(s) only for interested 'SpecificStats' types.
