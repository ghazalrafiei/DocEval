 * A PlanStage ("stage") is the basic building block of a "Query Execution Plan."  A stage is
 * the smallest piece of machinery used in executing a compiled query.  Stages either access
 * data (from a collection or an index) to create a stream of results, or transform a stream of
 * results (e.g. AND, OR, SORT) to create a stream of results.
 *
 * Stages have zero or more input streams but only one output stream.  Data-accessing stages are
 * leaves and data-transforming stages have children.  Stages can be connected together to form
 * a tree which is then executed (see plan_executor.h) to solve a query.
 *
 * A stage's input and output are each typed.  Only stages with compatible types can be
 * connected.
 *
 * All of the stages of a QEP share a WorkingSet (see working_set.h).  Data source stages
 * allocate a slot in the WorkingSet, fill the slot with data, and return the ID of that slot.
 * Subsequent stages fetch a WorkingSetElement by its ID and operate on the enclosed data.
 *
 * Stages do nothing unless work() is called.  work() is a request to the stage to consume one
 * unit of input.  Some stages (e.g. AND, SORT) require many calls to work() before generating
 * output as they must consume many units of input.  These stages will inform the caller that
 * they need more time, and work() must be called again in order to produce an output.
 *
 * Every stage of a query implements the PlanStage interface.  Queries perform a unit of work
 * and report on their subsequent status; see StatusCode for possible states.  Query results are
 * passed through the WorkingSet interface; see working_set.h for details.
 *
 * All synchronization is the responsibility of the caller.  Queries must be told to yield with
 * saveState() if any underlying database state changes.  If saveState() is called,
 * restoreState() must be called again before any work() is done.
 *
 * If an error occurs at runtime (e.g. we reach resource limits for the request), then work() throws
 * an exception. At this point, statistics may be extracted from the execution plan, but the
 * execution tree is otherwise unusable and the plan must be discarded.
 *
 * Here is a very simple usage example:
 *
 * WorkingSet workingSet;
 * PlanStage* rootStage = makeQueryPlan(&workingSet, ...);
 * while (!rootStage->isEOF()) {
 *     WorkingSetID result;
 *     switch(rootStage->work(&result)) {
 *     case PlanStage::ADVANCED:
 *         // do something with result
 *         WorkingSetMember* member = workingSet.get(result);
 *         cout << "Result: " << member->obj << std::endl;
 *         break;
 *     case PlanStage::IS_EOF:
 *         // All done.  Will fall out of while loop.
 *         break;
 *     case PlanStage::NEED_TIME:
 *         // Need more time.
 *         break;
 *     }
 *
 *     if (shouldYield) {
 *         // Occasionally yield.
 *         stage->saveState();
 *         // Do work that requires a yield here (execute other plans, insert, delete, etc.).
 *         stage->restoreState();
 *     }
 * }
