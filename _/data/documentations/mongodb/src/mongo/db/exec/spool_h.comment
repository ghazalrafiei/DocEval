 * Spools the inputs received from the child in a buffer. This is an eager spool: initially, on each
 * call to doWork() it reads as much as it can from its child (propagating yields and NEED_TIME) and
 * caches it in a buffer. Once the input has been exhausted, calls to doWork() return the cached
 * results.
 *
 * Note that to reduce memory and disk usage, the spool only caches RecordIds. Callers must fetch
 * the corresponding documents as needed.
