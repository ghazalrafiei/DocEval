 * Combines values from multiple streams into one stream. The union has n 'inputStages', each of
 * which provides m slots, specified as a vector of slot vectors 'inputVals'. (This vector has n * m
 * total slots.) The union stage itself also returns m slots, specified as 'outputVals'. Each of the
 * n branches is executed in turn until reaching EOF, and the values from its m slots are remapped
 * to the m output slots.
 *
 * This is a binding reflector, meaning that only the 'outputVals' slots are visible to stages
 * higher in the tree.
 *
 * Debug string repsentation:
 *
 *   union [<output slots>] [[<input slots 1>] childStage_1, ..., [<input slots n>] childStage_n]
