 * Implements a traditional nested loop join. For each advance from the 'outer' child, re-opens the
 * 'inner' child and calls 'getNext()' on the inner child until EOF. The caller can optionally
 * provide a join 'predicate' which is evaluated once per pair of outer and inner rows. If no
 * predicate expression is provided, then the Cartesian product is produced.
 *
 * For symmetry with hash join, this is a binding reflector on the outer side. Nodes higher in the
 * tree can only access those slots from the outer side that are named in 'outerProjects'. All slots
 * from the inner side are visible.
 *
 * The 'outerCorrelated' slots are slots from the outer side which are made visible to the inner
 * side.
 *
 * Debug string format:
 *
 *  nlj [<outer projects>] [<outer correlated>] { predicate }
 *      left childStage
 *      right childStage
