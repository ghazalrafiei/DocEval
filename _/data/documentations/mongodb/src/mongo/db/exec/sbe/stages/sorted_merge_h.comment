     * Constructor. Arguments:
     * -inputStages: Array of child stages. Each stage must return results in sorted order.
     * -inputKeys: Element 'i' of this vector describes which slots the sort key can be found in
     *  for child 'i'. Each element of this vector should have the same size as 'dirs'.
     * -dirs: Describes how to interpret the sort key.
     * -inputVals: Similar layout to 'inputKeys' but the slots hold additional values that should
     *  be propagated.
     * -outputVals: Slots where the output should be stored.
