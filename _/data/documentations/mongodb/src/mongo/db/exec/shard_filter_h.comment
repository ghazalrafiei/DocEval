 * This stage drops documents (called "orphans") that don't logically belong to this shard according
 * to the the provided 'collectionFilter'. No data should be returned from a query in ranges of
 * migrations that committed after the query started, or from ranges not owned when the query began.
 *
 * A related system will ensure that the data migrated away from a shard will not be deleted as long
 * as there are active queries from before the migration. By holding onto a copy of the provided
 * 'collectionFilter', this stage signals to the sharding subsystem that the data required at the
 * associated shard version cannot yet be deleted. In other words, no migrated data should be
 * removed from a shard while there are queries that were active before the migration.
 *
 * Preconditions: Child must be fetched.
