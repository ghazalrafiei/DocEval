 * A Baton is lightweight executor, with parallel forward progress guarantees.  Rather than
 * asynchronously running tasks through one, the baton records the intent of those tasks and defers
 * waiting and execution to a later call to run().

     * Detaches a baton from an associated opCtx.
     *
     * This invokes all callbacks currently inside the baton (from the detaching thread) with a void
     * opCtx.  Also, any calls to schedule after this point will immediately invoke their callback
     * with a null opCtx.

     * Schedules a callback to run on the baton.
     *
     * The function will be invoked in one of 3 ways:
     *   1. With an opCtx inside run() (I.e. opCtx->waitForConditionOrInterrupt)
     *   2. Without an opCtx inside detach()
     *   3. Without an opCtx inside schedule() after detach()
     *
     * Note that the latter two cases are indistinguishable, so the callback should be safe to run
     * inline if passed a nullptr.  Examples of such work are logging, simple cleanup and
     * rescheduling the task on another executor.

     * baton until it is detached.  After that point, all jobs within the sub baton should be failed
     * with a ShutdownInProgress status and all further work should be refused.
     *
     * NOTE: The held baton will not intercept networking() related calls.  If you intend to use the
     * baton in that mode, you should use this type with the ScopedTaskExecutor to handle
     * cancellation of async networking operations.
