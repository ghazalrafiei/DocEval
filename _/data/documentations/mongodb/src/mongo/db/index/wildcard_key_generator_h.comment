 * This class is responsible for generating an aggregation projection based on the keyPattern and
 * pathProjection specs, and for subsequently extracting the set of all path-value pairs for each
 * document.
 *
 * This key generator supports generating index keys for a compound or a single-field wildcard
 * index. If 'keyPattern' is compound, the generator will delagate the index key generation of
 * regular fields to two 'BtreeKeyGenerator'. At last it combines all these three parts
 * (prefix/suffix of regular fields and the wildcard field) into one 'KeyString'.

     * Returns an owned ProjectionExecutor identical to the one that WildcardKeyGenerator will use
     * internally when generating the keys for the $** index, as defined by the 'keyPattern' and
     * 'pathProjection' arguments.

     * Applies the appropriate Wildcard projection to the input doc, and then adds one key-value
     * pair to the set 'keys' for each leaf node in the post-projection document:
     *      { '': 'path.to.field', '': <collation-aware-field-value> }
     * Also adds one entry to 'multikeyPaths' for each array encountered in the post-projection
     * document, in the following format:
     *      { '': 1, '': 'path.to.array' }
