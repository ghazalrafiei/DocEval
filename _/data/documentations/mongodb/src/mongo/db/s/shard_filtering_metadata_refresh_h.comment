 * Must be invoked whenever code, which is executing on a shard encounters a StaleConfig error and
 * should be passed the placement version from the 'version received' in the exception. If the
 * shard's current placement version is behind 'chunkVersionReceived', causes the shard's filtering
 * metadata to be refreshed from the config server, otherwise does nothing and immediately returns.
 * If there are other threads currently performing refresh, blocks so that only one of them hits the
 * config server.
 *
 * If refresh fails for any reason (most commonly ExceededTimeLimit), returns a failed status.
 *
 * NOTE: Does network I/O and acquires collection lock on the specified namespace, so it must not be
 * called with a lock
 *
 * NOTE: This method is not expected to throw, because it is used in places where StaleConfig
 * exception was just caught and if it were to throw, it would overwrite any accumulated command
 * execution state in the response. This is specifically problematic for write commands, which are
 * expected to return the set of write batch entries that succeeded.

 * Invalidates the cached database version, schedules a refresh of the database info, waits for the
