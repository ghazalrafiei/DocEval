 * Runs doWork until it doesn't throw an error, the node is shutting down, the node has stepped
 * down, or the node has stepped down and up.
 *

 * or after the node has stepped down and up, only that 'doWork' will eventually stop being retried
 * if one of those events has happened.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - doWork must be idempotent.
