 * The BalancerStatsRegistry is used to cache metadata on shards, such as the orphan documents
 * count. The blancer (on the config sever) periodically fetches this metadata through the
 * _shardsvrGetStatsForBalancing command and uses it to evaluate balancing status of collections.
 *
 * The BalancerStatsRegistry is active only on replicaset primary nodes, it is initialized on stepUp
 * and terminated on stepDown.
