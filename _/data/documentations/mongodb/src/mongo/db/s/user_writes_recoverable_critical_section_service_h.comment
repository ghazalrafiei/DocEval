 * on disk and it's in-memory representation is kept in sync with the persisted state through an
 * OpObserver that reacts to the inserts/updates/deletes on the persisted document.

 * On replicaSets, enable blocking is depicted by transition (1); and disable blocking is depicted

     * Acquires the user writes critical section blocking only new sharded DDL operations, but not
     * user writes nor local DDL. This is a 'prepare' state before user writes and local DDL can be
     * blocked on sharded clusters.
     * Note: This method does not wait for ongoing DDL coordinators to finish. If the caller wishes
     * to ensure that any ongoing DDL operation has seen the new blocking state, the caller should
     * wait for the ShardingDDLCoordinators to drain itself.

     * Promotes a user writes critical section that is in the 'prepare' state (i.e. only blocking
     * sharded DDL) to start blocking also user writes. This should be run only after all shards in
     * the cluster have entered the 'prepare' state.
     ','line_number':120,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Demotes a user writes critical section that is blocking both sharded DDL and user writes to
     * only block sharded DDL. This is a preparation step before allowing user writes again on
     * sharded clusters.
     ','line_number':128,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Releases the user writes critical section, allowing user writes again. On sharded clusters,
     * before this method is called all shards must have first demoted their critical sections to no
     * longer block user writes.
     ','line_number':136,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * This method is called when we have to mirror the state on disk of the recoverable critical
     * section to memory (on startUp or on rollback).
