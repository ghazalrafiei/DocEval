 * When the auto-merger is enabled, it works as follows:
 * - Identify all the <shard, collection uuid> pairs for which there are mergeable chunks.
 * - While auto-merge is possible:
 * --- For each shard:
 * ----- For each namespace
 * ------- Schedule a mergeAllChunksOnShard command (max 1000 chunks per time)
 * ----- Apply throttling of `defaultAutoMergerThrottlingMS`
 * - Sleep for `autoMergerIntervalSecs`
