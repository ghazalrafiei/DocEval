     * Schedules a task that will do the following:
     *
     * - Find a valid connection to fetch oplog entries from.
     * - Send an aggregation request + getMores until either:
     * -- The "final resharding" oplog entry is found.
     * -- An interruption occurs.
     * -- The fetcher concludes it's fallen off the oplog.
     * -- A different error occurs.
     *
     * In the first two circumstances, the task will terminate. If the fetcher has fallen off the
     * oplog, this is thrown as a fatal resharding exception.  In the last circumstance, the task
     * will be rescheduled in a way that resumes where it had left off from.
