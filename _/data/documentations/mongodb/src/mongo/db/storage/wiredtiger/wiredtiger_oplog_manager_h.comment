 * Manages oplog visibility.
 *
 * On demand, queries WiredTiger's all_durable timestamp value and updates the oplog read timestamp.
 * This is done asynchronously on a thread that startVisibilityThread() will set up.
 *
 * The WT all_durable timestamp is the in-memory timestamp behind which there are no oplog holes
 * in-memory. Note, all_durable is the timestamp that has no holes in-memory, which may NOT be
 * the case on disk, despite 'durable' in the name.
 *
 * The oplog read timestamp is used to read from the oplog with forward cursors, in order to ensure
 * readers never see 'holes' in the oplog and thereby miss data that was not yet committed when
 * scanning passed. Out-of-order primary writes allow writes with later timestamps to be committed
 * before writes assigned earlier timestamps, creating oplog 'holes'.

     * The oplogReadTimestamp is the read timestamp used for forward cursor oplog reads to prevent
     * such readers from missing any entries in the oplog that may not yet have committed ('holes')
     * when the scan passes along the data. The 'oplogReadTimestamp' is a guaranteed 'no holes'
     * point in the oplog.
     *
     * Holes in the oplog occur due to out-of-order primary writes, where a write with a later
     * assigned timestamp can commit before a write assigned an earlier timestamp.
