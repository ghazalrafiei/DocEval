 * This class provides facility for saving bson objects to a flat file. The common use case is for
 * making a back-up copy of a document before an internal operation (like migration or rollback)
 * deletes it. To use this correctly, the caller must call goingToDelete first before the actual
 * deletion, otherwise the document will be lost if the process gets terminated in between.
