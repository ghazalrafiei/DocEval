 * SharedSpinLock routines.
 *
 * The spin lock's lock word is logically divided into a bit (kExclusiveLock) and an unsigned
 * integer value for the rest of the word.  The meanings are as follows:
 *
 * kExclusiveLock not set, rest of word 0: Lock not held nor waited on.
 *
 * kExclusiveLock not set, rest of word non-zero: Lock held in shared mode by the number of holders
 * specified in the rest of the word.
 *
 * kExclusiveLock set, rest of word 0: Lock held in exclusive mode, no shared waiters.
 *
 * kExclusiveLock set, rest of word non-zero: Lock held in exclusive mode, number of waiters for the
 * shared lock specified in the rest of the word.
 *
 * Note that if there are shared waiters when the exclusive lock is released, they will obtain the
 * lock before another exclusive lock can be obtained.  This should be considered an implementation
 * detail and not a guarantee.
