 * The ColumnIndexConsistency class is used to keep track of the index consistency in column-stor
 * indexes. It does this by using the index keys from index entries and index keys generated from
 * the document to ensure there is a one-to-one mapping for each key.
 * In addition, an IndexObserver class can be hooked into the IndexAccessMethod to inform this class
 * about changes to the indexes during a validation and compensate for them.
