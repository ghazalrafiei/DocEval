 * IndexCatalogImpl is stored as a member of CollectionImpl. When the Collection is cloned this is

     * Applies a set of transformations to the user-provided index object 'spec' to make it

     * Validates the 'original' index specification, alters any legacy fields and does plugin-level

     * Checks whether there are any spec conflicts with existing ready indexes or in-progress index
