 * 'CommitQuorumOptions' is used to determine when a primary should commit an index build. When the
 * specified 'quorum' of replica set members is reached, then the primary proceeds to commit the
 * index. commitQuorum ensures secondaries are ready to commit the index as quickly as possible:
 * secondary replication will stall on receipt of a commitIndexBuild oplog entry until the
 * secondary's index build is complete and ready to be committed.
 *
 * The 'CommitQuorumOptions' has the same range of settings as the 'w' field from
 * 'WriteConcernOptions'. It can be set to an integer starting from 0 and up, or to a string. The
 * string option can be 'majority', 'votingMembers' or a replica set tag.
