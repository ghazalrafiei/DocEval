 * This function generates an SbExpr that implements the filter expression represented by 'root'.
 * The 'inputSlot' and 'slots' parameters specify the input(s) that the filter should use.
 *
 * The 'isFilterOverIxscan' parameter controls if we should search for kField slots in 'slots' that
 * correspond to the full paths needed by the filter. Typically 'isFilterOverIxscan' is false unless
 * we are generating a filter over an index scan.
 *
 * If the caller sets 'isFilterOverIxscan' to true, then the caller must also provide a vector of
 * key field names ('keyFields') that lists the names of all the kField slots that are needed by
 * 'root'.
 *
 * This function returns an SbExpr. If 'root' is an AND with no children, this function will
 * return a null SbExpr to indicate that there is no filter condition.

 * Converts the list of bit positions inside of any of the bit-test match expressions
 * ($bitsAllClear, $bitsAllSet, $bitsAnyClear, and $bitsAnySet) to an SBE array, returned as a
 * (typeTag, value) pair. The caller owns the resulting value.
