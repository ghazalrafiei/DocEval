     * Checks solution nodes for geo match expressions to apply an optimization.
     *
     * If a geo match expression is on a field with a corresponding 2dsphere index we can
     * skip expensive validation of geometries in the matcher, since those geometries were
     * validated when they were indexed.

     * Takes an index key pattern and returns an object describing the "maximal sort" that this
     * index can provide.  Returned object is in normalized sort form (all elements have value 1
     * or -1).
     *
     * Examples:
     * - {a: 1, b: -1} => {a: 1, b: -1}
     * - {a: true} => {a: 1}
     * - {a: "hashed"} => {}
     * - {a: 1, b: "text", c: 1} => {a: 1}

     * In brief: performs sort and covering analysis.
     *
     * The solution rooted at 'solnRoot' provides data for the query, whether through some
     * configuration of indices or through a collection scan.  Additional stages may be required to
     * perform sorting, projection, or other operations that are independent of the source of the
     * data.  These stages are added atop 'solnRoot'.
     *
     * Returns a null pointer if a solution cannot be constructed given the requirements in
     * 'params'.

     * Internal helper function used by analyzeSort.
     *
     * Rewrites an index scan over many point intervals as an OR of many index scans in order to
     * obtain an indexed sort.  For full details, see SERVER-1205.
     *
     * Here is an example:
     *
     * Consider the query find({a: {$in: [1,2]}}).sort({b: 1}) with using the index {a:1, b:1}.
     *
     * Our default solution will be to construct one index scan with the bounds a:[[1,1],[2,2]]
     * and b: [MinKey, MaxKey].
     *
     * However, this is logically equivalent to the union of the following scans:
     * a:[1,1], b:[MinKey, MaxKey]
     * a:[2,2], b:[MinKey, MaxKey]
     *
     * Since the bounds on 'a' are a point, each scan provides the sort order {b:1} in addition
     * to {a:1, b:1}.
     *
     * If we union these scans with a merge sort instead of a normal hashing OR, we can preserve
     * the sort order that each scan provides.

     * Walks the QuerySolutionNode tree rooted in 'soln', and looks for a ProjectionNodeSimple that
     * is a child of GroupNode, and has a dependency set that's a super set of the the dependency
     * set of the GroupNode. If that condition is met the ProjectionNodeSimple is redundant and can
     * thus be elimiated to improve performance of the plan. Otherwise, this is a noop.

     * Walks the QuerySolutionNode tree rooted in 'soln', and looks for a ColumnScan that
     * is a child of either a Group or Projection.  If the ColumnScan's parent will ignore
     * extra fields, then eliminate its row store expression, allowing it to return extra fields
     * in cases when it falls back to pulling the full document from the row store.
     * If these conditions are not met this is a noop.

     * For the provided 'foreignCollName' and 'foreignFieldName' corresponding to an EqLookupNode,
     * returns what join algorithm should be used to execute it. In particular:
     * - An empty array is produced for each document if the foreign collection does not exist.
     * - An indexed nested loop join is chosen if an index on the foreign collection can be used to
     * answer the join predicate. Also returns which index on the foreign collection should be
     * used to answer the predicate.
     * - A hash join is chosen if disk use is allowed and if the foreign collection is sufficiently
     * small.
     * - A nested loop join is chosen in all other cases.

     * Checks if the foreign collection is eligible for the hash join algorithm. We conservatively
     * choose the hash join algorithm for cases when the hash table is unlikely to spill to disk.
