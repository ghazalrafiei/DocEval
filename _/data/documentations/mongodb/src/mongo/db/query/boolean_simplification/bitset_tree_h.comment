 * This node represents an un-normalized boolean expression. A bitset tree contains predicates in
 * leaf nodes stored in bitsets and internal nodes represent the tree structure. Every internal node
 * might a conjunction (AND) or disjunction (OR) of its children.
 *
 * MQL operators are represented as:
 * - $and => BitsetTreeNode{type: And, isNegated: false}, children are not negated
 * - $or => BitsetTreeNode{type: Or, isNegated: false}, children are not negated
 * - $nor => BitsetTreeNode{type: Or, isNegated: true}, children are not negated
 * - $not => child is negated
