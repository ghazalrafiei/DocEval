 * Truncates the 256 bit QueryShapeHash by taking only the first sizeof(size_t) bytes.
 ','line_number':58,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Struct which stores all query shape configurations for a given tenant, containing the same
 * information as the QuerySettingsClusterParameterValue. The data present in the 'settingsArray' is
 * stored in the QueryShapeConfigurationsMap for faster access.
 ','line_number':78,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Nested map structure which essentially serves as a mapping from 'NamespaceString' ->
     * 'QueryShapeHash' -> 'QueryShapeConfiguration'.
     *
     * Since computing the QueryShapeHash is the most expensive operation and its being done lazily,
     * it just makes sense to skip this part whenever possible. This additional mapping enables
     * first checking if there are any QueryShapeConfigurations set for the given namespace, and
     * exiting early if none are found.
     ','line_number':84,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Cluster time of the current version of the QuerySettingsClusterParameter.
     ','line_number':96,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Class responsible for managing in-memory storage and fetching of query settings. The in-memory
 * storage is eventually consistent with the query settings on other cluster nodes and is updated
 * based on OpObserver call performed when executing setClusterParameter command.
 *
 * Query settings in-memory storage is maintained separately for each tenant. In dedicated
 * environments the 'tenantId' argument passed to the methods must be boost::none.
 *
 * Query settings should only be retrieved through this class.
 ','line_number':102,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Performs the QuerySettings lookup by computing QueryShapeHash only in cases when at least one
     * QueryShapeConfiguration is set for the given namespace.
     ','line_number':130,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns (QuerySettings, QueryInstance) pair associated with the QueryShapeHash for the given
     * tenant. Always default to using the other 'getQuerySettingsForQueryShapeHash()' versions if
     * the 'NamespaceString' parameter is available.
     ','line_number':139,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns all QueryShapeConfigurations stored for the given tenant.
     ','line_number':149,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Sets the QueryShapeConfigurations by replacing an existing VersionedQueryShapeConfigurations
     * with the newly built one.
     ','line_number':155,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Updates the QueryShapeConfiguration cache by calling the 'clusterParameterRefreshFn'. This
     * can be a no-op if no 'clusterParameterRefreshFn' was provided in the constructor.
     ','line_number':164,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Removes all query settings documents for the given tenant.
     ','line_number':170,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the cluster parameter time of the current QuerySettingsClusterParameter value for the
     * given tenant.
     ','line_number':176,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Appends the QuerySettingsClusterParameterValue maintained as
     * VersionedQueryShapeConfigurations for the given tenant.
