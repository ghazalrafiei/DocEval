 * Creates a new 'PlanExecutor' capable of executing the query 'cq', or a non-OK status if a
 * plan executor could not be created.
 *
 * Passing YIELD_AUTO will construct a yielding executor which may yield in the following
 * circumstances:
 *   - During plan selection inside the call to make().
 *   - On any call to getNext().
 *   - On any call to restoreState().
 *   - While executing the plan inside executePlan().
 *
 * If auto-yielding is enabled, a yield during make() may result in the PlanExecutorImpl being
 * killed, in which case this method will return a non-OK status.
 *
 * The caller must provide either a non-null value for 'collection, or a non-empty 'nss'
 * NamespaceString but not both.
 *
 * Note that the PlanExecutor will use the ExpressionContext associated with 'cq' and the
 * OperationContext associated with that ExpressionContext.

 * This overload is provided for executors that do not need a CanonicalQuery. For example, the
 * outer plan executor for an aggregate command does not have a CanonicalQuery.
 *
 * Note that the PlanExecutor will use the OperationContext associated with the 'expCtx'
 * ExpressionContext.

 * Constructs a PlanExecutor for the query 'cq' which will execute the SBE plan 'root'. A yield
 * policy can optionally be provided if the plan should automatically yield during execution.

 * Similar to the factory function above in that it also constructs an executor for the winning SBE
 * plan passed in 'candidates' vector. This overload allows callers to pass a pre-existing queue
 * ('stash') of BSON objects or record ids to return to the caller.
