 * Represents a set of predicates and projections composed in a boolean expression in CNF or DNF.
 * Cannot represent all predicates/projections, only those that can typically be answered
 * efficiently with an index.
 *
 * The predicates take the following form, represented by type PartialSchemaEntry:
 *    {<path, inputProjection>, <interval, outputProjection>}
 *
 * For example, suppose there is a ScanNode which creates a binding 'scan_0' representing the
 * documents in a collection. To represent a conjunction which encodes filtering with array
 * traversal on "a" {$match: {a: {$gt, 1}} combined with a retrieval of the field "b" (without
 * restrictions on its value), the PartialSchemaEntries would look like:
 *      entry1: {<PathGet "a" Traverse Id, scan_0>,    <[1, +inf],     <none>>}
 *      entry2: {<PathGet "b" Id,          scan_0>,    <(-inf, +inf),  "pb">}.
 *
 * These entries could be composed in DNF: OR( AND( entry1, entry2 )). In this case we have a
 * trivial disjunction, where the top-level disjunction only has one child. Or, they could be
 * composed in CNF: AND( OR( entry1 ), OR( entry2 )).
 *
 * When representing a non-trivial disjunction, the PartialSchemaRequirements must not have any
 * output bindings.
 *
 * The default / empty state represents a conjunction of zero predicates, which means always true.

 * Given a DNF, try to detect and remove redundant terms.
 *
 * For example, in ((a ^ b) U (z) U (a ^ b ^ c)) the (a ^ b) is redundant because
 * (a ^ b ^ c) implies (a ^ b).
