 * This file contains the interface for rewriting filters within CRUD commands for FLE2.
 ','line_number':52,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Make a collator object from its BSON representation. Useful when creating ExpressionContext
 * objects for parsing MatchExpressions as part of the server-side rewrite.
 ','line_number':61,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Return a rewritten version of the passed-in filter as a BSONObj. Generally used by other
 * functions to process MatchExpressions in each command.
 ','line_number':68,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Process a find command with encryptionInformation in-place, rewriting the filter condition so
 * that any query on an encrypted field will properly query the underlying tags array.
 ','line_number':80,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Process a count command with encryptionInformation in-place, rewriting the filter condition so
 * that any query on an encrypted field will properly query the underlying tags array.
 ','line_number':89,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Process a pipeline with encryptionInformation by rewriting the pipeline to query against the
 * underlying tags array, where appropriate. After this rewriting is complete, there is no more
 * FLE work to be done. The encryption info does not need to be kept around (e.g. on a command
 * object).
 ','line_number':98,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Rewrite a filter MatchExpression with FLE Find Payloads into a disjunction over the tag array
 * from inside an existing transaction using a FLETagQueryInterface constructed from a
 * transaction client.
