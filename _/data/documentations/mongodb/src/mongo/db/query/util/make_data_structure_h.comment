 * Appends an element with an operator* to the end of a data structure. If the operator* produces
 * the data structure's element type, it will be called first unless the element argument is boolean
 * convertable to false. If this is the case, this function will perform no action. The bool
 * argument gives this function overload priority.

 * Appends an element to the end of a data structure. SFINAE backup for elements without an

 * Create a list. unlike an initializer list, this function will allow passing elements by Rvalue

 * dereferenceable and boolean convertable to false, it will be skipped.
