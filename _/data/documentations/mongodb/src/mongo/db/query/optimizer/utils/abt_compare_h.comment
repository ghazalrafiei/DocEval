 * Three way comparison of the two arguments via direct value interface without using constant
 * folding. The 'op' argument signifies how to interpret the 3w comparison - either as a boolean
 * comparison function, or directly as a 3w comparison.
 * - Returns kIncomparable if nothing can be determined about the comparison between the two
 * arguments.
 * - If op is {<, <=, >, >=}, return kTrue or kFalse depending on whether it is true or false.
 * - If op is a 3-way comparison, return -1 if lhs < rhs, or 1 lhs > rhs.
 * Notice that this function is not used for equality comparison.
