 * Defines an `enum class ENUM_` populated by `LIST_`.
 * Also defines an associated function `toStringData(ENUM_)`.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Define an enum class mongo::MyColors.
 *
 *       namespace mongo {
 *       #define MYCOLORS_TABLE(X) \
 *            X(red)               \
 *            X(green)             \
 *            X(blue)
 *
 *       QUERY_UTIL_NAMED_ENUM_DEFINE(MyColors, MYCOLORS_TABLE)
 *       #undef MYCOLORS_TABLE
 *       }  // namespace mongo
 *
 *   Its elements are MyColors::red, MyColors::green, and MyColors::blue. We
 *   also define an associated toStringData(MyColors) function which returns
 *   the unqualified value names "red", "green", "blue" as constexpr
 *   StringData. The array of unqualified StringData names is accessible via
 *   the arr_ field; in the example above, this would be MyColors_EnumString::arr_.
