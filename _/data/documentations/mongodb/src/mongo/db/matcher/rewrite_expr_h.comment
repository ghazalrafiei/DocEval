     * Holds the result of an Expression rewrite operation. $expr expressions can't take advantage
     * of indexes. When we rewrite the expressions as a conjunction of internal match expressions,
     * the query planner can now use the internal match expressions to potentially generate an index
     * scan. We use internal match expressions that are non-type bracketed to match non-type
     * bracketed comparison operators inside $expr.

     * Attempts to construct a MatchExpression that will match against either an identical set or a
     * superset of the documents matched by 'expr'. Due to semantic differences the rewritten
     * MatchExpression might match more documents than the ExprMatchExpression. For example,
     * $_internalExprEq in MatchExpression reaches into arrays, and $eq in ExprMatchExpression does
     * not. However, $_internalExprLt/$_internalExprGt are non-type bracketed for MatchExpression,
     * just like ExprMatchExpressions. Returns the MatchExpression as a RewriteResult. If a rewrite
     * is not possible, RewriteResult::matchExpression() will return a nullptr.
