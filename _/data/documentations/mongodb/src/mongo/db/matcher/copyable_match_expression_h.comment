 * Classes that must be copyable but want to own a MatchExpression (which deletes its copy
 * constructor) can instead store a CopyableMatchExpression.
 *
 * CopyableMatchExpression stores the BSON expression used to created its MatchExpression, so that
 * when we want to copy it, we can create a new MatchExpression that is identical to the old one. We
 * only actually perform this operation, however, when the client wants to mutate the
 * MatchExpression (by calling setCollator()). The rest of the time, copies of a
 * CopyableMatchExpression all point to the same immutable MatchExpression. This pattern is similar
 * to copy-on-write semantics.
