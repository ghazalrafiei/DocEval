 * Returns true if 'expr' has an $exists predicate on 'path.' Note that this only returns true

 * Checks if 'expr' has any subexpression which does not have renaming implemented or has renaming

 * This function also fills out 'renameables' with the renameable subexpressions. For
 * PathMatchExpression, the new path is returned in the second element of the pair. For
 * ExprMatchExpression, the second element should be ignored and renames must be applied based on
 * the full 'renames' map.
 *
 * Note: The 'renameables' is filled out while traversing the tree and so, designated as an output
 * parameter as an optimization to avoid traversing the tree again unnecessarily.

 * Returns true if the documents matched by 'lhs' are a subset of the documents matched by
 * 'rhs', i.e. a document matched by 'lhs' must also be matched by 'rhs', and false otherwise.
 *
 * With respect to partial indexes, 'lhs' corresponds to the query specification and 'rhs'
 * corresponds to the filter specification.
 *
 * e.g.
 *
 *  Suppose that
 *
 *      lhs = { x : 4 }
 *      rhs = { x : { $lte : 5 } }
 *

 * Determine if it is possible to split 'expr' into two MatchExpressions, where one is not
 * dependent on any path from 'pathSet', such that applying the two in sequence is equivalent
 * to applying 'expr'.
 *
 * For example, {a: "foo", b: "bar"} is splittable by "b", while
 * {$or: [{a: {$eq: "foo"}}, {b: {$eq: "bar"}}]} is not splittable by "b", due to the $or.

 ','line_number':135,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Returns true if any of the paths in 'testSet' are an ancestor of any of the other paths in

 ','line_number':179,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Returns whether the path represented by 'first' is an prefix of the path represented by 'second'.
 * Equality is not considered a prefix. For example:
 *
 * a.b is a prefix of a.b.c
 * a.b is not a prefix of a.balloon
 * a is a prefix of a.b
 * a is not a prefix of a
 * a.b is not a prefix of a

 ','line_number':202,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Applies 'func' to each node of 'expr', where the first argument is a pointer to that actual node
 * (not a copy), and the second argument is the path to that node. Callers should not depend on the
 * order of the traversal of the nodes.
 ','line_number':208,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Rewrites the match expression to assume that InternalExpr* match expressions return true. These
 * expressions are "imprecise" in that they can return true even for non-passing documents, and
 * rely on a second layer of filtering being applied later.
 ','line_number':215,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Attempt to split 'expr' into two MatchExpressions according to 'func'. 'func' describes the
 * conditions under which its argument can be split from 'expr'. Returns two pointers, where each
 * new MatchExpression contains a portion of 'expr'. The first (split out expression) contains the
 * parts of 'expr' which satisfy 'func', and the second (residual expression) are the remaining
 * parts of 'expr', such that applying the matches in sequence is equivalent to applying 'expr'. If
 * 'expr' cannot be split, returns {nullptr, expr}. If 'expr' can be entirely split, returns {expr,
 * nullptr}. Takes ownership of 'expr'.
 *
 * For example, the default behavior is to split 'expr' into two where the split out expression is
 * not reliant upon any path from 'fields', and the residual expression is the remainder.
 *
 * Any paths which might be renamed are encoded in 'renames', which maps from path names in 'expr'
 * to the new values of those paths. If the return value is {splitOutExpr, residualExpr} or
 * {splitOutExpr, nullptr}, splitOutExpr will reflect the path renames. For example, suppose the
 * original match expression is {old: {$gt: 3}} and 'renames' contains the mapping "old" => "new".
 * The returned exprLeft value will be {new: {$gt: 3}}, provided that "old" is not in 'fields'.
 *
 * Never returns {nullptr, nullptr}.
 ','line_number':226,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Applies the renames specified in 'renames' & 'renameables'. 'renames' maps from path names in
 * 'expr' to the new values of those paths. For example, suppose the original match expression is
 * {old: {$gt: 3}} and 'renames' contains the mapping "old" => "new". At the end, 'expr' will be
 * {new: {$gt: 3}}.
 *
 * In order to do an in-place renaming of the match expression tree, the caller should first call
 * 'hasOnlyRenameableMatchExpressionChildren()' and then call this function if it returns true,
 * passing through the resulting 'renameables'.
 *
 * Note: To enforce the above precondition, the caller should pass in the output of the call to
 * hasOnlyRenameableMatchExpressionChildren() as the 'renameables' argument. To avoid passing empty
 * vector for 'renameables' like applyRenamesToExpression(expr, {}, {}), the parameter is defined as
 * a pointer.
 ','line_number':252,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Copies the 'expr' and applies the renames specified in 'renames' to the copy of 'expr' and
 * returns the renamed copy of 'expr' if renaming is successful. Otherwise, returns nullptr.
 * 'renames' maps from path names in 'expr' to the new values of those paths. For example, suppose
 * the original match expression is {old: {$gt: 3}} and 'renames' contains the mapping "old" =>
 * "new". The returned expression will be {new: {$gt: 3}}.
 ','line_number':270,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Split a MatchExpression into two parts:
 *  - Filters which can be applied to one "column" at a time in a columnstore index. This will be
 *    returned as a map from path to MatchExpression. For this to be safe:
 *    - any predicate which does not  match should disqualify the entire document
 *    - any document which doesn't contain the path should not match.
 *  - A "residual" predicate which captures any pieces of the expression which cannot be pushed down
 *    into a column, either because it would be incorrect to do so, or we're not smart enough to do
 *    so yet.
