 * Keeps a local cache of the keys with the ability to refresh.

     * Check if there are new documents expiresAt > latestKeyDoc.expiresAt.
     ','line_number':57,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the internal key (see definition below) with an expiresAt value greater than
     * forThisTime. Returns KeyNotFound if there is no such key.
     ','line_number':62,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the internal key (see definition below) with the given keyId and an expiresAt value
     * greater than forThisTime. There should only be one matching key since keyId is unique for
     * keys generated within a cluster. Returns KeyNotFound if there is no such key.
     ','line_number':68,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the external keys (see definition below) with the given keyId and an expiresAt value
     * greater than forThisTime. There are a variable number of matching keys since keyId is not
     * necessarily unique across clusters. Returns KeyNotFound if there are no such keys.
