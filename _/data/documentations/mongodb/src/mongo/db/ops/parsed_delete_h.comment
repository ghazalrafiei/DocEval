 * This class takes a pointer to a DeleteRequest, and converts that request into a parsed form
 * via the parseRequest() method. A ParsedDelete can then be used to retrieve a PlanExecutor
 * capable of executing the delete.
 *
 * It is invalid to request that the DeleteStage return the deleted document during a
 * multi-remove. It is also invalid to request that a ProjectionStage be applied to the
 * DeleteStage if the DeleteStage would not return the deleted document.
 *
 * A delete request is parsed to a CanonicalQuery, so this class is a thin, delete-specific
 * wrapper around canonicalization.
