 * Simple intrusive list implementation for the lock's granted and conflicting lists. Does not
 * own its contents, just uses the intrusive pointers on the LockRequest structure to link them
 * together. Therefore requests must outlive this list.
 *
 * Intentionally implemented as a POD in order to avoid constructor/destructor invocations.
 *
 * NOTE: This class should not be used for generic purposes and should not be used outside of
 * the Lock Manager library.
