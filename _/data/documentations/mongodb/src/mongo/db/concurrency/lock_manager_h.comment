     * Acquires lock on the specified resource in the specified mode and returns the outcome
     * of the operation. See the details for LockResult for more information on what the
     * different results mean.
     *
     * Locking the same resource twice increments the reference count of the lock so each call
     * to lock must be matched with a call to unlock with the same resource.
     *
     * @param resId Id of the resource to be locked.
     * @param request LockRequest structure on which the state of the request will be tracked.
     *                 This value cannot be NULL and the notify value must be set. If the
     *                 return value is not LOCK_WAITING, this pointer can be freed and will
     *                 not be used any more.
     *
     *                 If the return value is LOCK_WAITING, the notification method will be called
     *                 at some point into the future, when the lock becomes granted. If unlock is
     *                 called before the lock becomes granted, the notification will not be
     *                 invoked.

     *                 If the return value is LOCK_WAITING, the notification object *must*
     *                 live at least until the notify method has been invoked or unlock has
     *                 been called for the resource it was assigned to. Failure to do so will
     *                 cause the lock manager to call into an invalid memory location.

     *                  called for the same LockRequest is an error.

     * Downgrades the mode in which an already granted request is held, without changing the
     * reference count of the lock request. This call never blocks, will always succeed and may
     * potentially allow other blocked lock requests to proceed.
     *
     * @param request Request, already in granted mode through a previous call to lock.
     * @param newMode Mode, which is less-restrictive than the mode in which the request is
     *                  already held. I.e., the conflict set of newMode must be a sub-set of
     *                  the conflict set of the request's current mode.

     * Dumps the contents of all locks into a BSON object
