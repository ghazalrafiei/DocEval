 * There is up to one 'config.system.preimages' collection per tenant. This pre-images
 * collection contains pre-images for every collection 'nsUUID' with pre-images enabled on the
 * tenant. The pre-images collection is ordered by collection 'nsUUID', so that pre-images belonging
 * to a given collection are grouped together. Additionally, pre-images for a given collection
 * 'nsUUID' are stored in timestamp order, which makes range truncation possible.
 *
 * Implementation of truncate markers for pre-images associated with a single collection 'nsUUID'
 * within a pre-images collection.

 * In a single-tenant environment, there is only one "system.config.preimages" pre-images
 * collection. In which case, the corresponding truncate markers are mapped to TenantId

 * Responsible for constructing and managing truncate markers across tenants - and for each tenant,
