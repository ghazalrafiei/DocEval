 * Interface for building oplog entries for an update. Provides methods for logging updates,
 * creations and deletes.
 *
 * The caller is expected to make sure all of the paths provided to the log*Field() methods are
 * valid. For example, a sequence of calls which updates field 'a' to the value "foo" and then
 * attempts to update field 'a.b' is a programming error.
 ','line_number':39,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * These methods are used to log a modification to an existing field at given path. The field
     * name provided in the 'elt' argument is ignored.
     ','line_number':51,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * This method is used to log creation of a new field at the given path. The
     * 'idxOfFirstNewComponent' argument indicates where the _first_ new component in the path
     * is. For example, if an update operating on the document {a: {}} sets field 'a.b.c.d', the
     * first new component would be at index 1 ('b').
     *
     * The field name in the 'elt' argument is ignored.

     * Logs deletion of a field.
