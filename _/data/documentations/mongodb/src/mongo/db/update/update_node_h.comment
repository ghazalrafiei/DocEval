 * Update modifier expressions are stored as a prefix tree of UpdateNodes, where two modifiers that
 * share a field path prefix share a path prefix in the tree. The prefix tree is used to enforce
 * that no update modifier's field path is a prefix of (or equal to) another update modifier's field
 * path. The root of the UpdateNode tree is always an UpdateObjectNode. The leaves are always
 * UpdateLeafNodes.
 *
 * Example: {$set: {'a.b': 5, c: 6}, $inc: {'a.c': 1}}
 *
 *                      UpdateObjectNode
 *                         a /    \ c
 *            UpdateObjectNode    SetNode: _val = 6
 *               b /    \ c
 * SetNode: _val = 5    IncNode: _val = 1

     * Creates a new node by merging the contents of two input nodes. The semantics of the merge
     * operation depend on the types of the input nodes. When the nodes have the same type, this

     * Produces a map of serialization components for an update. The map is indexed according to
     * operator name. The value of each map entry is a vector of operator components. These two
     * components are an operator field, which is a string representing a path, and an operator
     * value, which is a BSONObj of the arguments to the operation. 'currentPath' keeps running
     * track of the full path to the current node. Note that, although produceSerializationMap()
     * mutates its 'currentPath' FieldRef for use in recursive calls, it always restores the
     * original value before the function returns so the caller will witness no change.

     * Set the collation. This is a noop if the UpdateExecutor subclass does not require a collator.
     * If setCollator() is called, it is required that the current collator is the simple collator
     * (nullptr). The collator must outlive the modifier interface. This is used to override the
     * collation after obtaining a collection lock if the update did not specify a collation and the
     * collection has a non-simple default collation.
