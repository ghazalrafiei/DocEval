 * This is a base class to allow for traversal of an update tree. It implements the visitor
 * pattern, in which every derived class from update node implements an acceptVisitor() method,
 * which simply calls the appropriate visit() method on the derived UpdateNodeVisitor class. The
 * derived class can do whatever it needs to do for each specific node type in the corresponding
 * visit() method.
 * Derived classes are responsible for making the recursive calls to visit() if they wish
 * to visit all the nodes in the update node tree. UpdateNodeVisitor's purpose is not actually to
 * ensure that every node in the tree is visited, but rather to handle dynamic dispatch without
 * having to add virtual methods to the UpdateNode interface itself.
