 * Takes a user write concern as well as the replication opTime the write concern applies to -

 * Returns result of the write concern if successful.
 * Returns NotWritablePrimary if the host steps down while waiting for replication
 * Returns UnknownReplWriteConcern if the wMode specified was not enforceable
