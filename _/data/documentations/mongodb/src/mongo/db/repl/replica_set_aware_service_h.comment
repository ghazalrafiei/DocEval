 * ReplicaSetAwareServices are those that need to respond to changes in per-node replication state,
 * such as becoming primary, stepping down, and entering rollback.
 *
 * Using this interface avoids the need to manually hook the various places in
 * ReplicationCoordinatorExternalStateImpl where these events occur.
 *
 * To define a ReplicaSetAwareService, a class needs to:
 *
 * 1. Inherit from ReplicaSetAwareService (templated on itself).
 * 2. Implement the pure virtual methods in ReplicaSetAwareInterface.
 * 3. Store a singleton object of the class somewhere (ideally as a ServiceContext decoration).
 * 4. Define a public static `get(ServiceContext*)` function.
 * 5. Define a static ReplicaSetAwareServiceRegistry::Registerer object to declare the name (and
 *    optionally pre-requisite services) of the service.
 *
 * If the service should only be active in certain configurations, then the class should override
 * shouldRegisterReplicaSetAwareService.  For the common cases of services that are only active on
 * config servers, the class can inherit from ReplicaSetAwareServiceConfigSvr (instead of
 * ReplicaSetAwareService).  Similarly, shard-only services can inherit from
 * ReplicaSetAwareServiceShardSvr.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * #include "mongo/db/replica_set_aware_service.h"
 *
 * class FooService : public ReplicaSetAwareService<FooService> {
 * public:
 *     static FooService* get(ServiceContext* serviceContext);
 *
 *     // ...
 *
 * private:
 *     // Optional:
 *     virtual bool shouldRegisterReplicaSetAwareService() const final {
 *         return ...;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Mandatory:
 *     void onStartup(OperationContext* opCtx) final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onSetCurrentConfig(OperationContext* opCtx) final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onShutdown() final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onStepUpBegin(OperationContext* opCtx) final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onStepUpComplete(OperationContext* opCtx) final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onStepDown() final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onRollback() final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onBecomeArbiter() final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * namespace {
 *
 * const auto _fooDecoration = ServiceContext::declareDecoration<FooService>();
 *
 * const ReplicaSetAwareServiceRegistry::Registerer<FooService> _fooServiceRegisterer("FooService");
 *
 * }  // namespace
 *
 * FooService* FooService::get(ServiceContext* serviceContext) {
 *     return _fooDecoration(serviceContext);
 * }

 * Main API implemented by each ReplicaSetAwareService.
 ','line_number':123,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Called once during ReplicationCoordinator startup. A place to put startup logic such as
     * initializing thread pools. Cannot depend on the ReplicaSetConfig being loaded yet. Database
     * reads and writes to unreplicated collections are permitted.
     ','line_number':128,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Called when the ReplicationCoordinator sets its replica set config, e.g. after processing
     * replSetInitiate, reconfiguring via heartbeat, or processing replSetReconfig. May be called
     * multiple times and not necessarily in the order the configs were processed.
     ','line_number':135,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Called when either initial sync or startup recovery have completed.
     * Local reads are always available at this point, with no special restrictions on resource
     * locks. If the "isMajorityDataAvailable" flag is set, the data read locally is also committed
     * to a majority of replica set members. In the opposite case, the local data may be subject to
     * rollback attempts, which will also crash the server.
     * This is one of the first hooks that a node will run after starting up and this is expected to
     * be evoked strictly before any calls to onRollback, although it may be preceded by OpObserver
     * calls. In-memory state may be reconstructed here, pending the difference in data availability
     * described above.
     ','line_number':142,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Called as part of ReplicationCoordinator shutdown.
     * Note that it is possible that we are still a writable primary after onShutdown() has been
     * called (see SERVER-81115).
     ','line_number':155,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Called prior to stepping up as PRIMARY, i.e. after drain mode has completed but before
     * the RSTL is acquired.
     * Implementations of this method should be short-running in order to prevent blocking
     * the stepUp from completing.
     ','line_number':162,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Called after the node has transitioned to PRIMARY, i.e. after stepUp reconfig and after
     * writing the first oplog entry with the new term, but before the node starts accepting
     * writes.
     * Implementations of this method should be short-running in order to prevent blocking
     * the stepUp from completing.
     ','line_number':170,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Called after the node has transitioned out of PRIMARY. Usually this is into SECONDARY, but it
     * could also be into ROLLBACK or REMOVED.
     *
     * NB: also called when SECONDARY nodes transition to ROLLBACK, hence it should never be assumed
     * that `onStepUp` hooks have been invoked at least once before this method is invoked.
     ','line_number':179,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Called after the node has transitioned to ROLLBACK.
     ','line_number':188,'multiline':True]['text':'*

     ','line_number':193,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the name of the service. Used for logging purposes.
     ','line_number':198,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * The registry of ReplicaSetAwareServices.
 ','line_number':205,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * The main ReplicaSetAwareService class that services inherit from.  Refer to the comment at the

     * Internal, called only by ReplicaSetAwareServiceRegistry::Registerer.
     ','line_number':288,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Services should override this if they wish to only be registered in certain circumstances.
     * For the common cases of config/shard-server only, it's better to use the
     * ReplicaSetAwareServiceConfigSvr and ReplicaSetAwareServiceShardSvr convenience classes
     * defined below.
     ','line_number':295,'multiline':True]['text':'*
