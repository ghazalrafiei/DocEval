 * This interface provides helper functions for maintaining the documents used for
 * maintaining data consistency.
 *
 * The minValid document, in 'local.replset.minvalid', is used for indicating whether or not the
 * data on disk is consistent and for getting to a consistent point after unclean shutdown.
 *
 * Example of all fields:
 * {
 *      _id: <ObjectId>,                    // not used, but auto-generated
 *      ts: <Timestamp>,
 *      t: <long long>,                     // timestamp and term of minValid OpTime
 *      doingInitialSync: <bool>,
 *      begin: {
 *                  ts: <Timestamp>,
 *                  t: <long long>
 *             },                           // field for 'appliedThrough'
 * }
 *
 * The oplogTruncateAfterPoint document, in 'local.replset.oplogTruncateAfterPoint', is used to
 * indicate how much of the oplog is consistent and where the oplog should be truncated when
 * entering recovery.
 *
 * Example of all fields:
 * {
 *      _id: 'oplogTruncateAfterPoint',
 *      oplogTruncateAfterPoint: <Timestamp>
 * }
 *
 * See below for explanations of each field.
 *
 * The initialSyncId document, in 'local.replset.initialSyncId', is used to detect when nodes have
 * been resynced. It is set at the end of initial sync, or whenever replication is started when the
 * document does not exist.
 *
 * Example of all fields:
 * {
 *      _id: <UUID>,
 *      wallTime: <Date_t>
 * }

     * Sets the minValid OpTime to 'minValid'. This can set minValid backwards, which is necessary
     * in rollback when the OpTimes in the oplog may move backwards. We usually only call this
     * function in rollback via refetch, so we need to check the storage engine's rollback method to
     * enforce that via an invariant. However, there are exceptions where we need to set the
     * minValid document outside of rollback with an untimestamped write. In that case, we can
     * ignore the storage engine's rollback method by setting the 'alwaysAllowUntimestampedWrite'
     * parameter to true.

     * Ensures that the fast-count counter for the oplogTruncateAfterPoint collection is properly
     * set. An unclean shutdown can result in a miscount, if the persisted size store is not updated
     * before the crash. Rollback usually handles this for user collections, but local, unreplicated
     * collections are not adjusted.
     ','line_number':155,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * On startup all oplog entries with a ts field >= the oplog truncate after point will be
     * deleted. If the truncate point is null, no oplog entries are truncated. A null truncate point
     * can be found on startup if the server was certain at the time of shutdown that there were no
     * parallel writes running.
     *
     * Write operations are done in parallel, creating momentary oplog 'holes' where writes at an
     * earlier timestamp are not yet committed. Secondaries can read an oplog entry from a
     * sync-source as soon as there are no holes behind the oplog entry in-memory, but before there
     * are no holes behind the oplog entry on disk. Therefore, after a crash, the oplog is truncated
     * back to its on-disk no holes point that is guaranteed to be consistent with the rest of the
     * replica set.
     *
     * A primary will update the oplog truncate after point before every journal flush to disk with
     * the storage engine tracked in-memory no holes point.
     *
     * For other replication states than PRIMARY, the oplog truncate after point is updated
     * directly. For batch application, the oplog truncate after point is set to the current
     * lastApplied timestamp prior to writing a batch of oplog entries into the oplog, and reset to
     * null once the parallel oplog entry writes are complete.
     *
     * Concurrency control and serialization is the responsibility of the caller.
     *
     * This fasserts on write failure.

     * Indicates whether the oplog truncate after point is currently in use (being periodically
     * refreshed), which is only done while in state PRIMARY.
     *
     * This class stores its own relevant replication state knowledge to avoid potential deadlocks
     * in accessing the replication coordinator's mutex to check; and will remain false for
     * standalones that do not use timestamps.
     ','line_number':201,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Initializes the oplog truncate after point with the timestamp of the latest oplog entry.
     *
     * On stepup to primary, the truncate point must be initialized to protect the window of time
     * between completion of stepup and the first periodic flush to disk that prompts a truncate
     * point update. Otherwise, in-memory writes (with no holes) can replicate while the on-disk
     * writes still have holes, at which point we could crash, leaving this node with unknown data
     * holes that other nodes do not have (they have the data).

     * Updates the OplogTruncateAfterPoint with the latest no-holes oplog timestamp.

     * If primary, returns the OpTime and WallTime of the oplog entry associated with the updated
     * oplog truncate after point.

     *
     * stopUsingOplogTruncateAfterPointForPrimary() will cause new calls to this function to do
     * nothing, but any already running callers of this function will need to be interrupted to
     * ensure the state change is in effect (that an update will not racily go ahead).
     *
     * Throws write interruption errors up to the caller.
     ','line_number':222,'multiline':True]['text':' -------- Applied Through ----------','line_number':238,'multiline':False]['text':'*
     * The applied through point is a persistent record of which oplog entries we've applied.
