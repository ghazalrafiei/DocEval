     * Represents next steps of task runner.
     ','line_number':55,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Creates a Task returning kCancel. This is useful in shutting down the task runner after
     * running a series of tasks.
     *
     * Without a cancellation task, the client would need to coordinate the completion of the
     * last task with calling cancel() on the task runner.

     * Schedules a task to be run by the task runner. Tasks are run in the same order that they
     * are scheduled.
     *
     * This transitions the task runner to an active state.
     *
     * The task runner creates an operation context using the current client
     * prior to running a scheduled task. Depending on the NextAction returned from the
     * task, operation contexts may be shared between consecutive tasks invoked by the task
     * runner.
     *
     * On completion, each task is expected to return a NextAction to the task runner.
     *
     *     If the task returns kDisposeOperationContext, the task runner destroys the operation
     *     context. The next task to be invoked will receive a new operation context.
     *
     *     If the task returns kKeepOperationContext, the task runner will retain the operation
     *     context to pass to the next task in the queue.
     *
     *     If the task returns kCancel, the task runner will destroy the operation context and
     *     cancel the remaining tasks (each task will be invoked with a status containing the
     *     code ErrorCodes::CallbackCanceled). After all the tasks have been canceled, the task
     *     runner will become inactive.
     *
     *     If the task returns kInvalid, this NextAction will be handled in the same way as
     *     kDisposeOperationContext.
     *
     * If the status passed to the task is not OK, the task should not proceed and return
     * immediately. This is usually the case when the task runner is canceled. Accessing the
     * operation context in the task will result in undefined behavior.

     * invoked with a status containing the code ErrorCodes::CallbackCanceled.
     * After all active tasks have completed and unscheduled tasks have been canceled, the
     * task runner will go into an inactive state.
     *
     * It is a no-op to call cancel() before scheduling any tasks.
