 * This class manages collections that are marked as drop-pending by the 2-phase algorithm.
 *
 * Replicated collections that are dropped are not permanently removed from the storage system
 * when the drop collection request is first processed. Instead, the collection is renamed to a
 * hidden collection in the same database with a special namespace (<db>.system.drop.*).
 *
 * On receiving a notification in the replica set state (eg. commit level), some drop-pending
 * with drop optimes will become safe to remove permanently. This class provides the function
 * dropCollectionsOlderThan() for this purpose.

     * There can only be one matching collection per database and at most two entries per optime

     * We cannot reconstruct the original namespace so we must get it passed in. It accepts the

     * This function also removes the entry from '_dropPendingNamespaces'.
     * This function returns false if there is no drop-pending collection at the specified optime.
