     * Brings the TopologyCoordinator from follower to candidate by simulating a period of time in
     * which the election timer expires and starts a dry run election.
     * Returns after dry run is completed but before actual election starts.
     * If 'onDryRunRequest' is provided, this function is invoked with the

     * a successful dry run vote response.

     * Same as simulateSuccessfulV1Election, but rather than getting the election timeout and
     * progressing time past that point, takes in what time to expect an election to occur at.
     * Useful for simulating elections triggered via priority takeover.

     * Transition the ReplicationCoordinator from drain mode to being fully primary/master.
