 * FTDCCompressor is responsible for taking a set of BSON documents containing metrics, and
 * compressing them into a highly compressed buffer. Metrics are defined as BSON number or number
 * like type (like dates, and timestamps).
 *
 * Compression Method
 * 1. For each document after the first, it computes the delta between it and the preceding document
 *    for the number fields
 * 2. It stores the deltas into an array of std::int64_t.
 * 3. It compressed each std::int64_t using VarInt integer compression. See varint.h.
 * 4. Encodes zeros in Run Length Encoded pairs of <Count, Zero>
 * 5. ZLIB compresses the final processed array
 *
 * NOTE: This compression ignores non-number data, and assumes the non-number data is constant
 * across all documents in the series of documents.
