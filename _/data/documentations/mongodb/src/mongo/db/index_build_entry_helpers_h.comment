 * Creates the "config.system.indexBuilds" collection if it does not already exist.
 * This is the collection where the IndexBuildEntries will be stored on disk for active index
 * builds.
 *
 * The collection should exist before calling any other helper functions to prevent them from
 * failing.
 ','line_number':63,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Persist the host and port information about the replica set members that have voted to commit an
 * index build into config.system.indexBuilds collection. If the member info is already present in
 * the collection for that index build, then we don't do any updates and don't generate any errors.
 *
 * Returns an error if collection is missing.

 * Persist the new commit quorum value for an index build into config.system.indexBuilds collection.
 *
 * Returns an error if collection is missing.

 * Writes the 'indexBuildEntry' to the disk.
 *
 * An IndexBuildEntry should be stored on the disk during the duration of the index build process
 * for the 'indexBuildEntry'.
 *
 * Returns 'DuplicateKey' error code if a document already exists on the disk with the same
 * 'indexBuildUUID'.
 ','line_number':90,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Removes the IndexBuildEntry from the disk.
 *
 * An IndexBuildEntry should be removed from the disk when the index build either succeeds or fails
 * for the given 'indexBuildUUID'.
 *
 * Returns 'NoMatchingDocument' error code if no document with 'indexBuildUUID' is found.
 ','line_number':101,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Returns the IndexBuildEntry matching the document with 'indexBuildUUID' from the disk if it
 * exists. Reads at "no" timestamp i.e, reading with the "latest" snapshot reflecting up to date
 * data.
 *
 * If the stored IndexBuildEntry on disk contains invalid BSON, the 'InvalidBSON' error code is
 * returned.
 *
 * Returns 'NoMatchingDocument' error code if no document with 'indexBuildUUID' is found.
 ','line_number':113,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Returns the 'commitQuorum' matching the document with 'indexBuildUUID' from disk if it
 * exists.
 *
 * Returns 'NoMatchingDocument' error code if no document with 'indexBuildUUID' is found.
 ','line_number':125,'multiline':True]['text':'*
 * Sets the documents 'commitQuorum' field matching the document with 'indexBuildUUID'.
 *
 * Since the commit quorum is configurable until the index build is committed, this should be called
 * whenever the commit quorum is changed.
 *
 * Returns 'NoMatchingDocument' error code if no document with 'indexBuildUUID' is found.
 *
 * Used for testing only.
