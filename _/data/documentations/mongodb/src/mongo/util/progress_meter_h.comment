 * Wraps a CurOp owned ProgressMeter and calls finished() when destructed. This may only exist as
 * long as the underlying ProgressMeter.
 *
 * The underlying ProgressMeter will have the same locking requirements as CurOp (see CurOp class
 * description). Accessors and modifiers on the underlying ProgressMeter may need to be performed
 * while holding a client lock and specifying the WithLock argument. If accessing without a client
 * lock, then the thread must be executing the associated OperationContext.
