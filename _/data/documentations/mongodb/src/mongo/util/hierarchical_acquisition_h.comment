 * Hierarchical acquisition types are light-weight wrappers around bitwise math
 *
 * Each Level is a bitmap with a single bit set. The corresponding IndexType index for each Level is
 * how many bits that level's bit is right shifted from the greatest bit in the internal ValueType
 * value. So a Level 0 (L0) will be the bitmap 0X8000000000000000000000000. Likewise, a Level 63
 * (L63) bitmap will be 0X0000000000000000000000001. This provides a fairly obvious mathematical
 * property:
 *   La < Lb <=> value(La) > (Lb)
 *
 * Each Set is a more classical bitmap. When a Level is added to a Set, the Level's bit is set in
 * the Set's underlying value. When a Level is removed from a Set, the Level's bit is removed from
 * the Set's underlying value. The rule is that each Level added to a Set must be less than any
 * previously added Level. Likewise, each Level removed from a Set must be less than any
 * remaining Level in the Set. Translated to math, the following is a pre-condition for adding a
 * level L to a set S and a post-condition for removing a level L to a set S:
 *   value(L) > value(S)
 *
 * In the interest of allowing the developer more flexibility and keeping these types simple, Set
 * functions do not throw or return ErrorCodes, instead they return small enums. Note that
 * operations always go through, even if the result is kInvalid.

 * Level is a constexpr type that encodes an integer value into a bitmap
 *
 * This class is designed for use in non-type template parameters like so:
 * template<Level kLevel>
 * struct Foo {
 *   void bar() {
 *     gSet.add(kLevel);
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * Note that LT/LTE/GT/GTE operators are internally reversed because a low Level means a high
 * ValueType.
