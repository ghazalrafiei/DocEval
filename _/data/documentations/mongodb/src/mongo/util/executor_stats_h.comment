 * A utility to collect stats for tasks scheduled on an executor (e.g., the reactor thread).
 *
 * This class expects a clock source to measure the waiting and execution time of tasks. The clock
 * source must always outlive instances of this class.
 *
 * This class collects stats for any task that is wrapped using `wrapTask`. The wrapped task may
 * never outlive the instance of `ExecutorStats`.
 *
 * All public interfaces for this class are thread-safe.
 ','line_number':40,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * The following maintain histograms for tasks scheduled on the executor:
     * `_waitingBuckets` represents the waiting time for the tasks pending execution.
     * `_runningBuckets` keeps track of execution time of individual tasks after completion.
     * Buckets 0 represents any recorded latency less than 1 milliseconds.
     * Buckets 1 to 20 represent the 1-999 ms range.
     * The last bucket represents any recorded latency that exceeds one second.
