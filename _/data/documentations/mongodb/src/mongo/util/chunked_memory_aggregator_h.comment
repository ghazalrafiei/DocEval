 * Leaf nodes of the tree, which are allocated from `ChunkedMemoryAggregator` nodes. These are meant
 * to only ever be used in a single-threaded context. These handles are how memory updates are made
 * to the tree, no updates can be made directly to `ConcurrentMemoryAggregator` or
 * `ChunkedMemoryAggregator`, they must all be made through the `MemoryUsageHandle`. A
 * `ChunkedMemoryAggregator` can have many `MemoryUsageHandle` nodes under it. Updates are always
 * sent to the `ChunkedMemoryAggregator` every time a child `MemoryUsageHandle` is updated.

 * Tracks memory usage in a thread-safe manner through `MemoryUsageHandle`s which are allocated
 * through `createUsageHandle()`. You can have many active usage handles for a single
 * `ChunkedMemoryAggregator` (e.g. you can call `createUsageHandle()` more than once), and each
 * individual handle will propagate it's memory updates to the same `ChunkedMemoryAggregator`
 * instance.
 *
 * `ChunkedMemoryAggregator` reports approximate memory usage to the parent
 * `ConcurrentMemoryAggregator`, based on
 * `ChunkedMemoryAggregator::Options::memoryUsageUpdateBatchSize`. The larger the batch size, the
 * less updates to the parent memory aggregator but less accurate aggregated memory usage in the
 * parent aggregator, while the smaller the batch size, the more frequent updates to the parent
 * memory aggregator and more accurate aggregated memory usage in the parent aggregator. This will
 * *always* over-count the memory usage and never under-count, e.g. if the batch size is 32MB, and a
 * usage handle under a `ChunkedMemoryAggregator` uses 10 bytes, that will be rounded up and
 * reported to the parent `ConcurrentMemoryAggregator` as 32MB of memory usage.
 *
 * You should use `ConcurrentMemoryAggregator::createChunkedMemoryAggregator` to create an instance
 * of a chunked memory aggregator. All updates made to a chunked memory aggregator's usage handle is
 * propagated to the chunked memory aggregator, which then propagates it to the parent
 * `ConcurrentMemoryAggregator` only if there has been a significant change in memory since the last
 * update to the `ConcurrentMemoryAggregator` to avoid contention since memory updates may be very
 * frequent and since `ConcurrentMemoryAggregator` is meant to be shared across multiple threads.
