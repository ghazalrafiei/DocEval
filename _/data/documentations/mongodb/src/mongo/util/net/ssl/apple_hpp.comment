 * CoreFoundation types are internally refcounted using CFRetain/CFRelease.
 * Values received from a method using the word "Copy" typically follow "The Copy Rule"
 * which requires that the caller explicitly invoke CFRelease on the obtained value.
 * Values received from a method using the word "Get" typically follow "The Get Rule"
 * which requires that the caller DOES NOT attempt to release any references,
 * though it may invoke CFRetain to hold on to the object for longer.
 *
 * Use of the CFUniquePtr type assumes that a value was wither obtained from a "Copy"
 * method, or that it has been explicitly retained.

 * Equivalent of OpenSSL's SSL_CTX type.
 * Allows loading SecIdentity and SecCertificate chains
 * separate from an SSLContext instance.
 *
 * Unlike OpenSSL, Secure Transport sets protocol range on
 * each connection instance separately, so just stash them aside
 * in the same place for now.
