 * Configure a TCP socket's keepalive options on Windows.

 * On Windows, there has historically been no way to query a socket's TCP
 * keepalive parameters. We guess from the registry what the settings would be.
 * If the registry is missing a key, we use the defaults documented at MSDN.
 *
 * As of Windows 10, version 1709, the TCP keepalive settings are available as
 * IPPROTO_TCP options just as on macOS and Linux, and this setup can be much
 * simpler eventually.

 * Applies a maximum to a socket option. Gets the specified option from `sock`,
 * and if its current value is greater than `maxVal`, sets it to `maxVal`.
 * Failures are logged with `severity`, and if the get operation fails, we do
 * not attempt the set operation.
