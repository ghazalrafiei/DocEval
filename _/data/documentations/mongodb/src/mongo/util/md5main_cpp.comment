  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
  text is available at
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
  The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
  (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
  any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
