 * Provides a singleton object that allows enforcing a single-threaded context at startup.
 *
 * This class, currently, intercepts `stdx::thread` creations and aborts the process if a single
 * threaded context is expected.
 *
 * You should avoid using the interfaces that specify single-threaded context (i.e.,
 * `forbidMultiThreading()` and `allowMultiThreading()`) outside the main function.
 *
 * If using other APIs for spawning threads (e.g., `pthread_create()`), make sure to precede the
 * API call with `onThreadCreate()`.
