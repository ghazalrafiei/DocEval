 * Constructs an RPC Reply.
 ','line_number':55,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Sets the raw command reply. This should probably not be used in favor of the
     * variants that accept a Status or StatusWith.
     ','line_number':65,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns a BSONObjBuilder that can be used to build the reply in-place. The returned
     * builder (or an object into which it has been moved) must be completed before calling
     * any more methods on this object. A builder is completed by a call to `done()` or by
     * its destructor. Can be called repeatedly to append multiple things to the reply, as
     * long as each returned builder is completed between calls.
     ','line_number':71,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns a DocSeqBuilder for building a command reply in place. This should only be called
     * before the body as the body will have status types appended at the end.
     ','line_number':80,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Sets the reply for this command. If an engaged StatusWith<BSONObj> is passed, the command
     * reply will be set to the contained BSONObj, augmented with the element {ok, 1.0} if it
     * does not already have an "ok" field. If a disengaged StatusWith<BSONObj> is passed, the
     * command reply will be set to {ok: 0.0, code: <code of status>,
     *                               codeName: <name of status code>,
     *                               errmsg: <reason of status>}
     ','line_number':88,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Sets the reply for this command. The status parameter must be non-OK. The reply for
     * this command will be set to an object containing all the fields in extraErrorInfo,
     * augmented with {ok: 0.0} , {code: <code of status>}, {codeName: <name of status code>},
     * and {errmsg: <reason of status>}.
     * If any of the fields "ok", "code", or "errmsg" already exist in extraErrorInfo, they
     * will be left as-is in the command reply. This use of this form is intended for
     * interfacing with legacy code that adds additional data to a failed command reply and
     * its use is discouraged in new code.
     ','line_number':98,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Gets the protocol used to serialize this reply. This should be used for validity checks
     * only - runtime behavior changes should be implemented with polymorphism.
     ','line_number':110,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Resets the state of the builder to kMetadata and clears any data that was previously
     * written.
     ','line_number':116,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Writes data then transfers ownership of the message to the caller. The behavior of
     * calling any methods on the builder is subsequently undefined.
     * Can throw BSONObjectTooLarge if the internal buffer has grown too large to be converted
     * to a Message within the BSON size limit.
     ','line_number':122,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * The specified 'object' must be BSON-serializable.
     *
     * BSONSerializable 'x' means 'x.serialize(bob)' appends a representation of 'x'
     * into 'BSONObjBuilder* bob'.
     ','line_number':130,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Reserves and claims bytes for the Message generated by this interface.
     ','line_number':145,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * For exhaust commands, returns whether the command should be run again.
     ','line_number':150,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the next invocation for an exhaust command. If this is boost::none, the previous
     * invocation should be reused for the next invocation.
     ','line_number':155,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * For exhaust commands, indicates that the command should be run again and sets the next
