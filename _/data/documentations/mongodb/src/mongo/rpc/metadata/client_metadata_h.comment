 * The ClientMetadata class is responsible for parsing the client metadata document that is received
 * in the "client" field of the first hello from clients. The client metadata document can also be
 * parsed from the "$client" field of any operation. This class also provides static methods for
 * client libraries to write a valid client metadata document.
 *
 * Example client metadata document:
 * {
 *     "application" : {              // Optional
 *         "name" : "string"          // Optional with caveats
 *     },
 *     "driver" : {                   // Required, Informational Only
 *         "name" : "string",         // Required, Informational Only
 *         "version" : "string"       // Required, Informational Only
 *     },
 *     "os" : {                       // Required, Informational Only
 *         "type" : "string",         // Required, Informational Only, See note
 *         "name" : "string",         // Optional, Informational Only
 *         "architecture" : "string", // Optional, Informational Only
 *         "version" : "string"       // Optional, Informational Only
 *     }
 *     "mongos" : {                   // Optional, Informational Only
 *         "host" : "string",         // Optional, Informational Only
 *         "client" : "string",       // Optional, Informational Only
 *         "version" : "string"       // Optional, Informational Only
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * It is allowed to contain additional fields that are not listed in the example above. These
 * additional fields are ignore by this class. The "os" document "type" field is required (defaults
 * to "unknown" in Mongo Drivers). The "driver", and "os" documents while required, are for
 * informational purposes only. The content is logged to disk but otherwise ignored.
 *
 * See Driver Specification: "MongoDB Handshake" for more information.
