 * An interface for augmenting egress networking components with domain-specific metadata handling
 * logic.

 * TODO: At some point we will want the opposite of this interface (readRequestMetadata,
 * writeReplyMetadata) that we will use for ingress networking. This will allow us to move much
 * of the metadata handling logic out of Command::run.

     * Writes to an outgoing request metadata object. This method must not throw or block on
     * database or network operations and can be called by multiple concurrent threads.
     *
     * opCtx may be null as writeRequestMetadata may be called on ASIO background threads, and may
     * not
     * have an OperationContext as a result.
