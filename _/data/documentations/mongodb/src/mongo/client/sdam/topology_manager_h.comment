     * This function atomically:
     *   1. Clones the current TopologyDescription
     *   2. Executes the state machine logic given the cloned TopologyDescription and provided
     * HelloOutcome (containing the new ServerDescription).
     *   3. Installs the cloned (and possibly modified) TopologyDescription as the current one.

     * This function updates the RTT value for a server without executing any state machine actions.
     * It atomically:
     *   1. Clones the current TopologyDescription
     *   2. Clones the ServerDescription corresponding to hostAndPort such that it contains the new
     * RTT value.
     *   3. Installs the cloned ServerDescription into the TopologyDescription from step 1
     *   4. Installs the cloned TopologyDescription as the current one.

     * Executes the given function with the current TopologyDescription while holding the mutex.
