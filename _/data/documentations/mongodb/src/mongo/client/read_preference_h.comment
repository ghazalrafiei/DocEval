 * Validate a ReadPreference string. This is intended for use as an IDL validator callback.

 * A simple object for representing the list of tags requested by a $readPreference.
 ','line_number':62,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Creates a TagSet that matches any nodes. This is the TagSet represented by the BSON
     * array containing a single empty document - [{}].
     *
     * Do not call during static init.
     ','line_number':67,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns an empty TagSet. This is the TagSet represented by the empty BSON array - [].
     * This TagSet must be associated with ReadPreference::PrimaryOnly.
     * ReadPreference::Primary.
     ','line_number':75,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Creates a TagSet from a BSONArray of tags.
     *
     * @param tags the list of tags associated with this option. This object
     *     will get a shared copy of the list. Therefore, it is important
     *     for the the given tag to live longer than the created tag set.
     ','line_number':82,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Returns the BSONArray listing all tags that should be accepted.

     * The minimal value maxStalenessSeconds can have.

     * An object representing the metadata generated for a SecondaryPreferred read preference:

     ','line_number':117,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * @param pref the read preference mode.

     * Serializes this ReadPreferenceSetting as an inner BSON document. (The document inside a

     * Serializes this ReadPreferenceSetting as a containing BSON document. (The document containing
     * a $readPreference element)

     * Parses a ReadPreferenceSetting from a BSON document of the form:
     * { mode: <mode>, tags: <array of tags>, maxStalenessSeconds: Number, hedge: <hedgingMode>}.
     * The 'mode' element must be a string equal to either "primary", "primaryPreferred",
     * "secondary", "secondaryPreferred", or "nearest". Although the tags array is intended to be an
     * array of unique BSON documents, no further validation is performed on it other than checking
     * that it is an array, and that it is empty if 'mode' is 'primary'. The 'hedge' element
     * consists of the optional field "enabled" (default true) and "delay" (default true).

        Utilized by IDL types in order to get the unwrapped ReadPreferenceSetting object.
        It checks that the status is OK and then if so it will return the underlying object.
    ','line_number':199,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Parses a ReadPreference setting from an object that may contain a $readPreference object
     * field with the contents described in fromInnerObject(). If the field is missing, returns the
     * default read preference.
     ','line_number':205,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Describes this ReadPreferenceSetting as a string.
     ','line_number':213,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Used by Server Selection to ensure that the Timestamp component of a node's current opTime
     * (ie. the opTime but ignoring the term) is at least this value.  Unless there are no known
     * nodes satisfying this condition, in which case it is ignored.
     *
     * It is valid to use ClusterTime values in minClusterTime because if a node has an opTime of X,
     * then that means it must have either:
     *
     * 1. Directly advanced the ClusterTime to X when doing that write as primary, or
     *
     * 2. Applied the op with that opTime after receiving it in a message from some other node; that
     *    message must (by the same recursive logic, if necessary) have gossiped a ClusterTime of at
     *    least X to this node.
     *
     * Either way, it must be that a node opTime of X implies ClusterTime >= X.
