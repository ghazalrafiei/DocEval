 * A cache for the intermediate steps of the SCRAM-SHA-1 computation.
 *
 * Clients wishing to authenticate to a server using SCRAM-SHA-1
 * must produce a set of credential objects from their password,
 * a salt, and an iteration count. The computation to generate these
 * is very expensive, proportional to the iteration count. The high
 * cost of this computation prevents brute force attacks on
 * intercepted SCRAM authentication data, or a stolen password
 * database. The inputs to the function are unlikely to frequently
 * change. Caching the relationship between the inputs and the
 * resulting output should make repeated authentication attempts
 * to a single server much faster.
 *
 * This is explicitly permitted by RFC5802, section 5.1:
 *
 * "Note that a client implementation MAY cache
 * ClientKey&ServerKey (or just SaltedPassword) for later
 * reauthentication to the same service, as it is likely that the
 * server is going to advertise the same salt value upon
 * reauthentication.  This might be useful for mobile clients where
 * CPU usage is a concern."
