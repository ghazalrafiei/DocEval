 * Implementation Scope for MozJS
 *
 * The Implementation scope holds the actual mozjs runtime and context objects,
 * along with a number of global prototypes for mongoDB specific types. Each
 * ImplScope requires it's own thread and cannot be accessed from any thread
 * other than the one it was created on (this is a detail inherited from the
 * JSRuntime). If you need a scope that can be accessed by different threads
 * over the course of it's lifetime, see MozJSProxyScope
 *
 * For more information about overriden fields, see mongo::Scope

     * This structure exists exclusively to construct the runtime and context
     * ahead of the various global prototypes in the ImplScope construction.
     * Basically, we have to call some c apis on the way up and down and this
     * takes care of that
