 * Helper for the JSThread javascript object
 *
 * The workflow is strange because we have a thing in javascript called a
 * JSThread, but we don't actually get to construct it. Instead, we have to
 * inject methods into that thing (via _threadInject) and hang our C++ thread
 * separately (via init() on that type).
 *
 * To manage lifetime, we just add a field into the injected object that's our
 * JSThread and add our holder in as our JSThread's private member.

     * Note that this isn't meant to supply methods for JSThread, it's just
     * there to work with _threadInject. So the name isn't a mistake
