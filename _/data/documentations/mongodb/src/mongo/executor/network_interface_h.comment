     * Starts up the network interface.
     *
     * It is valid to call all methods except shutdown() before this method completes.  That is,
     * implementations may not assume that startup() completes before startCommand() first
     * executes.

     * Similar to waitForWork, but only blocks until "when".
     ','line_number':130,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Signals to the network interface that there is new work (such as a signaled event) for

     * Starts asynchronous execution of the command described by "request".

     * The request mutated to append request metadata to be merged into the request messages.

     * Returns ErrorCodes::ShutdownInProgress if NetworkInterface::shutdown has already started
     * and Status::OK() otherwise. If it returns Status::OK(), then the onFinish argument will be
     * executed by NetworkInterface eventually; otherwise, it will not.
     *

     * function will not run.

     * Requests cancellation of the network activity associated with "cbHandle" if it has not yet
     * completed.
     *

     * function. Do not hold locks while calling cancelCommand(...).

     * Sets an alarm, which schedules "action" to run no sooner than "when".
     *
     * Returns ErrorCodes::ShutdownInProgress if NetworkInterface::shutdown has already started
     * and true otherwise. If it returns Status::OK(), then the action will be executed by
     * NetworkInterface eventually if no error occurs while waiting for the alarm; otherwise,
     * it will not.
     *
     * "action" should not do anything that requires a lot of computation, or that might block for a
     * long time, as it may execute in a network thread.
     *
     * Any callbacks invoked from setAlarm must observe onNetworkThread to
     * return true. See that method for why.

     * Returns true if called from a thread dedicated to networking. I.e. not a
     * calling thread.
     *
     * This is meant to be used to avoid context switches, so callers must be
     * able to rely on this returning true in a callback or completion handler.
     * In the absence of any actual networking thread, always return true.
     ','line_number':245,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Drops all connections to the given host in the connection pool.
     ','line_number':255,'multiline':True]['text':'*
     * Acquire a connection and subsequently release it.
     * If status is not OK, the connection will be dropped,
     * otherwise the connection will be returned to the pool.

     * An RAII type that NetworkInterface uses to allow users to access a stream corresponding to a
     * single network-level (i.e. TCP, UDS) connection on which to run commands directly. Generally
     * speaking, users should use the NetworkInterface itself to run commands to take advantage of
     * connection-pooling, hedging, and other features - but for special cases where users need to
     * borrow their own network-stream for manual use, they can lease one through this type.
     * LeasedStreams are minimal and do not offer automated health-management/automated refreshing
     * while on lease - users are responsible for examining the health of the stream as-needed if
     * they desire. Users are also responsible for reporting on the health of stream before the
     * lease ends so that it can be subsequently re-used; see comments below for detail.
