 * Executor with notions of events and callbacks.
 *
 * Callbacks represent work to be performed by the executor.
 * They may be scheduled by client threads or by other callbacks.  Methods that
 * schedule callbacks return a CallbackHandle if they are able to enqueue the callback in the
 * appropriate work queue.  Every CallbackHandle represents an invocation of a function that
 * will happen before the executor goes out of scope.  Calling cancel(CallbackHandle) schedules
 * the specified callback to run with a flag indicating that it is "canceled," but it will run.
 * Client threads may block waiting for a callback to execute by calling wait(CallbackHandle).
 *
 * Events are level-triggered and may only be signaled one time.  Client threads and callbacks
 * may schedule callbacks to be run by the executor after the event is signaled, and client
 * threads may ask the executor to block them until after the event is signaled.
 *
 * If an event is unsignaled when shutdown is called, the executor will ensure that any threads
 * blocked in waitForEvent() eventually return.
