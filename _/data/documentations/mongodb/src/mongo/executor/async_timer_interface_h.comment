     * Cancel any asynchronous operations waiting on this timer, invoking
     * their handlers immediately with an 'operation aborted' error code.

     * If the timer has already expired when cancel() is called, the handlers
     * for asyncWait operations may have already fired or been enqueued to
     * fire soon, in which case we cannot cancel them.
