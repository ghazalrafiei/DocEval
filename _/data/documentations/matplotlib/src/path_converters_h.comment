 This file contains a number of vertex converters that modify
 paths. They all work as iterators, where the output is generated
 on-the-fly, and don't require a copy of the full data.

 Each class represents a discrete step in a "path-cleansing" pipeline.
 They are currently applied in the following order in the Agg backend:

   1. Affine transformation (implemented in Agg, not here)

   2. PathNanRemover: skips over segments containing non-finite numbers
      by inserting MOVETO commands

   3. PathClipper: Clips line segments to a given rectangle.  This is
      helpful for data reduction, and also to avoid a limitation in
      Agg where coordinates cannot be larger than 24-bit signed
      integers.

   4. PathSnapper: Rounds the path to the nearest center-pixels.
      This makes rectilinear curves look much better.

   5. PathSimplifier: Removes line segments from highly dense paths
      that would not have an impact on their appearance.  Speeds up
      rendering and reduces file sizes.

   6. curve-to-line-segment conversion (implemented in Agg, not here)

   7. stroking (implemented in Agg, not here)
